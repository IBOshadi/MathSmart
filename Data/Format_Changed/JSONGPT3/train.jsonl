{"prompt": "There is a subway that runs at 288 centimeters (cm) per second. If the length of the subway is 20 meters (m), and it takes 25 seconds to completely get through the platform, how long is the platform in meters (m)?", "completion": "First, we need to convert the speed of the subway from centimeters per second to meters per second. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, we divide the speed in centimeters per second by 100 to get the speed in meters per second.\n\nSpeed in meters per second = 288 cm/s \u00f7 100 = 2.88 m/s\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distance the subway travels in 25 seconds. We can do this by multiplying the speed in meters per second by the time in seconds.\n\nDistance traveled in 25 seconds = Speed in meters per second \u00d7 Time in seconds\nDistance traveled in 25 seconds = 2.88 m/s \u00d7 25 s = 72 meters\n\nThe distance the subway travels in 25 seconds is the length of the subway plus the length of the platform. We know the length of the subway is 20 meters, so we can subtract this from the total distance to find the length of the platform.\n\nLength of the platform = Distance traveled in 25 seconds - Length of the subway\nLength of the platform = 72 meters - 20 meters = 52 meters\n\nTherefore, the platform is 52 meters long."}

{"prompt": "There are different numbers A, B, C, and D. Find the sum of A, B, C, and D in the four-digit addition formula DCBA+ABCD=ABCD0.", "completion": "Let's analyze the given four-digit addition formula:\n\nDCBA\n+ ABCD\n---------\nABCD0\n\nWe are given that A, B, C, and D are different numbers. The sum results in a five-digit number ABCD0, where the last digit is 0. This means that when A (the units digit of the first number) is added to D (the units digit of the second number), the sum must be a multiple of 10. Since A and D are different, the only possibility is that A + D = 10.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens place. We have B (from DCBA) adding to C (from ABCD), and since we are carrying over 1 from the previous addition of A and D, we have B + C + 1. This sum must give us a result where the tens digit is D and the units digit contributes to the next carry over. Since A + D = 10, we know D cannot be 9 because A and D are different and A cannot be 0 (otherwise, it wouldn't be a four-digit number). Therefore, the maximum value for D is 8, which would make A = 2. This means the maximum value for B + C + 1 is 18 (if B and C were both 9, which is not possible since all digits are different). So, B + C + 1 must equal 10 + D.\n\nMoving to the hundreds place, we have C (from DCBA) adding to B (from ABCD), and we are carrying over 1 from the tens place. So, we have C + B + 1. This sum must give us a result where the hundreds digit is C and the units digit contributes to the next carry over. Since we already have B + C + 1 = 10 + D, we can deduce that C + B + 1 must also equal 10 + B.\n\nFinally, looking at the thousands place, we have D (from DCBA) adding to A (from ABCD), and we are carrying over 1 from the hundreds place. So, we have D + A + 1. This sum must give us a result where the thousands digit is A and the units digit contributes to the next carry over. Since A + D = 10, we know that D + A + 1 = 11, which means the carry over to the ten-thousands place is 1, giving us the A in the ten-thousands place of the result ABCD0.\n\nNow, let's find the values of A, B, C, and D that satisfy these conditions:\n\n1. A + D = 10\n2. B + C + 1 = 10 + D\n3. C + B + 1 = 10 + B\n4. D + A + 1 = 11\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that A and D are complements to 10. Let's assume A = 1 and D = 9 (we can switch them later if needed).\n\nWith A = 1 and D = 9, condition 4 is satisfied (1 + 9 + 1 = 11).\n\nNow, let's use condition 2 with D = 9: B + C + 1 = 19. Since B and C are different and cannot be 1 or 9, the possible pairs are (B, C) = (8, 0) or (0, 8). Let's choose B = 8 and C = 0 (we can switch them later if needed).\n\nWith B = 8 and C = 0, condition 3 is satisfied (0 + 8 + 1 = 9, which is 10 + 0 - 1).\n\nNow we have A = 1, B = 8, C = 0, and D = 9. The sum of A, B, C, and D is:\n\nA + B + C + D = 1 + 8 + 0 + 9 = 18\n\nTherefore, the sum of A, B, C, and D is 18."}

Since 5/16 of the roses are yellow, we can calculate the number of yellow roses by multiplying the total number of roses by 5/16:\n\nNumber of yellow roses = (5/16) * 48\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can first divide 48 by 16 and then multiply by 5:\n\nNumber of yellow roses = (48 / 16) * 5\nNumber of yellow roses = 3 * 5\nNumber of yellow roses = 15\n\nNow, to find out how many more red roses there are than yellow roses, we subtract the number of yellow roses from the number of red roses:\n\nNumber of more red roses than yellow roses = Number of red roses - Number of yellow roses\nNumber of more red roses than yellow roses = 18 - 15\nNumber of more red roses than yellow roses = 3\n\nSo, there are 3 more red roses than yellow roses."}

Since the cards are rectangular, we can try to arrange them in such a way that the width of one card aligns with the length of another to form a square pattern.\n\nThe smallest common multiple of 5 and 7 is their product, as they are both prime numbers and have no common factors other than 1.

{"prompt": "For the natural numbers A, B, and C, when A is divided by 8, the quotient is B and the remainder is C. If the quotient and the remainder are equal, find the largest number of A.", "completion": "Let's denote A as the natural number we are looking for, B as the quotient when A is divided by 8, and C as the remainder. According to the problem, B = C.\n\nWhen a number A is divided by 8, the remainder C can be any number from 0 to 7 because the remainder is always less than the divisor. Since B and C are equal, B can also be any number from 0 to 7.\n\nThe largest possible value for B and C, when they are equal, is 7. Therefore, the largest possible remainder when A is divided by 8 is 7, and the quotient is also 7.\n\nWe can express A as follows:\nA = 8B + C\n\nSince B = C and both are equal to 7, we have:\nA = 8(7) + 7\nA = 56 + 7\nA = 63\n\nTherefore, the largest number A for which the quotient and the remainder are equal when A is divided by 8 is 63."}

{"prompt": "There are 12 crates of 200 and 150 in total. When 2180 apples were divided into these boxes, leaving 30 apples. How many boxes of 200 are there?", "completion": "Let's denote the number of boxes of 200 apples as x and the number of boxes of 150 apples as y. According to the problem, there are a total of 12 crates, so we can write the equation:\n\nx + y = 12  (1)\n\nWe also know that when 2180 apples were divided into these boxes, 30 apples were left. This means that the total number of apples that were put into the boxes is 2180 - 30 = 2150. We can write another equation based on the number of apples in each type of box:\n\n200x + 150y = 2150  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of x and y.\n\nFirst, let's multiply equation (1) by 150 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same:\n\n150x + 150y = 1800  (3)\n\nNow let's subtract equation (3) from equation (2):\n\n(200x + 150y) - (150x + 150y) = 2150 - 1800\n50x = 350\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\nx = 350 / 50\nx = 7\n\nSo there are 7 boxes of 200 apples. Since we know there are 12 crates in total, we can find the number of boxes of 150 apples by subtracting the number of boxes of 200 apples from the total number of crates:\n\ny = 12 - x\ny = 12 - 7\ny = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 7 boxes of 200 apples and 5 boxes of 150 apples."}

{"prompt": "I gave 7 indistinguishable locks to Jungkook and Hoseok. Jungkook and Hoseok each received at least one lock. Find the number of ways to divide locks.", "completion": "To find the number of ways to divide the 7 indistinguishable locks between Jungkook and Hoseok, given that each must receive at least one lock, we can use a method similar to the \"stars and bars\" technique from combinatorics.\n\nSince each person must get at least one lock, we can start by giving one lock to Jungkook and one lock to Hoseok. This leaves us with 7 - 2 = 5 locks to distribute.\n\nNow, we can think of the problem as finding the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable items (locks) into 2 distinguishable bins (Jungkook and Hoseok). We can represent the locks as stars (*) and the decision point (or divider) between Jungkook's and Hoseok's locks as a bar (|).\n\nFor example, if Jungkook gets 3 more locks and Hoseok gets 2 more locks, it would look like this: ***|**.\n\nSince we have 5 locks to distribute, we will have 5 stars. There will be 1 bar to divide the locks between the two people. The total number of positions is 5 (for the locks) + 1 (for the bar) = 6.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these items is the number of ways to choose positions for the bar (or, equivalently, the stars) out of the 6 positions. Since we have 1 bar, we need to choose 1 position for it out of the 6 available positions.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 position out of 6 is simply 6 (since we can place the bar in any of the 6 positions, and the remaining positions will automatically be filled with stars).\n\nSo, there are 6 different ways to divide the 7 indistinguishable locks between Jungkook and Hoseok when each must receive at least one lock."}

Yuna is two positions before Hoseok, so she is the first person in the line, being the shortest.\n\nWhen they line up in descending order, the positions reverse, with the tallest person being first. Since Yuna was the shortest in ascending order, she will be at the end of the line in descending order.\n\nWith nine people in the line, if Yuna is at the end in descending order, she will be in the ninth position.\n\nSo, Yuna will be in the ninth position in descending order."}

Find the maximum number of trucks in the orchard.", "completion": "To find the maximum number of trucks, we need to determine the number of fruits that can be loaded equally into each truck. Since there are leftovers and shortages, we need to adjust the total count of each fruit to reflect the number that can be evenly distributed.\n\nFor apples, we have 170 apples with 8 left over, so the number that can be evenly distributed is 170 - 8 = 162 apples.\n\nFor tangerines, we are 2 short, so we need to add 2 to the total to find the number that can be evenly distributed: 268 + 2 = 270 tangerines.\n\nFor mangoes, we have 120 mangoes with 12 left over, so the number that can be evenly distributed is 120 - 12 = 108 mangoes.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these three numbers (162, 270, and 108) to determine the maximum number of trucks that can be used to evenly distribute the fruits.\n\nLet's find the GCD:\n\nGCD of 162 and 270:\n162 = 2 \u00d7 3^4 \u00d7 1\n270 = 2 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 5\n\nThe common factors are 2 and 3^3 (which is 27), so the GCD of 162 and 270 is 2 \u00d7 27 = 54.\n\nNow, let's find the GCD of 54 and 108:\n54 = 2 \u00d7 3^3\n108 = 2^2 \u00d7 3^3\n\nThe common factors are 2 and 3^3 (which is 27), so the GCD of 54 and 108 is 2 \u00d7 27 = 54.\n\nSince the GCD of all three numbers is 54, this means that the fruits can be evenly distributed into 54 trucks. However, since we are looking for the maximum number of trucks, we need to divide each of the adjusted fruit totals by 54 to see if they all divide evenly.\n\n162 \u00f7 54 = 3 (evenly distributed)\n270 \u00f7 54 = 5 (evenly distributed)\n108 \u00f7 54 = 2 (evenly distributed)\n\nSince all three numbers divide evenly by 54, the maximum number of trucks that can be used to evenly distribute the fruits is 54."}

{"prompt": "In a park with a perimeter of 18 kilometers (km), Soyun and Jia started off at the same time from the same place, but in opposite directions, and met on the way. It is said that Soyun ran at 5 kilometers (km) per hour and Jia ran at 4 kilometers (km) per hour. How far did Soyun run?", "completion": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. When two objects move in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSoyun's speed = 5 km/h\nJia's speed = 4 km/h\n\nRelative speed = Soyun's speed + Jia's speed\nRelative speed = 5 km/h + 4 km/h\nRelative speed = 9 km/h\n\nSince they meet after running around the park with a perimeter of 18 km, it means they have covered the entire perimeter together.\n\nLet's denote the time it took for them to meet as t (in hours). We can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSince they meet after covering the entire perimeter together, we can write:\n\n18 km = Relative speed \u00d7 Time\n18 km = 9 km/h \u00d7 t\n\nNow, we solve for t:\n\nt = 18 km / 9 km/h\nt = 2 hours\n\nNow we know that they met after 2 hours.

So the total surface area of the original cube is \\(6 \\times 100 \\text{ cm}^2 = 600 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nEach face of the original cube has a smaller cube dug out from its center. The smaller cube has an edge length of 2 cm, so each face of the smaller cube has an area of \\(2 \\text{ cm} \\times 2 \\text{ cm} = 4 \\text{ cm}^2\\). Since each smaller cube has 6 faces, the total area removed from each face of the original cube is \\(6 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 24 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nHowever, we must consider that each small cube is dug out from the center of each face of the larger cube, so only one face of each small cube is actually removed from the larger cube's surface area. Therefore, for each face of the original cube, we subtract the area of one face of the smaller cube, which is \\(4 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nSince there are 6 faces on the original cube, the total area removed is \\(6 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 24 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nNow, we need to add the area of the sides of the dug-out cubes that are now part of the surface. Each small cube has 5 faces contributing to the new surface area (since one face is the hole itself). Each of these faces has an area of \\(4 \\text{ cm}^2\\), so the total area added for each small cube is \\(5 \\times 4 \\text{ cm}^2 = 20 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nSince there is one small cube dug out from each face of the original cube, and there are 6 faces, the total area added is \\(6 \\times 20 \\text{ cm}^2 = 120 \\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the total surface area of the new shape by subtracting the area removed and adding the area added to the original surface area:\n\nOriginal surface area: \\(600 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\nArea removed: \\(-24 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\nArea added: \\(+120 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\n\nTotal surface area of the new shape: \\(600 \\text{ cm}^2 - 24 \\text{ cm}^2 + 120 \\text{ cm}^2 = 696 \\text{ cm}^2\\)\n\nSo the surface area of the new shape is \\(696 \\text{ cm}^2\\)."}

{"prompt": "How many three-digit numbers are divisible by 4 and 5?", "completion": "To find the three-digit numbers divisible by both 4 and 5, we need to find the three-digit numbers divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 5.\n\nThe LCM of 4 and 5 is 20 because 20 is the smallest number that both 4 and 5 can divide without leaving a remainder.\n\nNow, we need to find the range of three-digit numbers that are divisible by 20. The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999.\n\nTo find the smallest three-digit number divisible by 20, we can divide 100 by 20 and find the next whole number that results in a remainder of zero when multiplied by 20. \n\n100 \u00f7 20 = 5 with no remainder, so 100 is divisible by 20.\n\nTo find the largest three-digit number divisible by 20, we can divide 999 by 20 and find the whole number that results in a remainder of zero when multiplied by 20.\n\n999 \u00f7 20 = 49 with a remainder. The whole number part is 49, so the largest three-digit number divisible by 20 is 49 * 20 = 980.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of three-digit numbers divisible by 20 by subtracting the smallest multiple from the largest multiple and then dividing by 20, and adding 1 to include both endpoints.\n\n(980 - 100) \u00f7 20 + 1 = 880 \u00f7 20 + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 three-digit numbers that are divisible by both 4 and 5."}
{"prompt": "Gyeong-seok studies Korean 7 times a week, 2/3 hours each, and Math 5 times a week, 3/4 hours each. Find out which subject Kyung-seok studies more during the week, Korean or math.", "completion": "To find out which subject Gyeong-seok studies more during the week, we need to calculate the total hours spent on each subject.\n\nFor Korean:\nGyeong-seok studies 7 times a week for 2/3 hours each time.\nTotal hours for Korean = 7 times * (2/3) hours/time\nTotal hours for Korean = 7 * (2/3)\nTotal hours for Korean = 14/3\nTotal hours for Korean = 4 2/3 hours\n\nFor Math:\nGyeong-seok studies 5 times a week for 3/4 hours each time.\nTotal hours for Math = 5 times * (3/4) hours/time\nTotal hours for Math = 5 * (3/4)\nTotal hours for Math = 15/4\nTotal hours for Math = 3 3/4 hours\n\nNow, let's compare the total hours for each subject:\nKorean = 4 2/3 hours\nMath = 3 3/4 hours\n\nTo compare them more easily, let's convert them to improper fractions:\nKorean = (4 * 3 + 2)/3 = (12 + 2)/3 = 14/3\nMath = (3 * 4 + 3)/4 = (12 + 3)/4 = 15/4\n\nNow, to compare these two fractions, we can find a common denominator.

{"prompt": "A prism has 24 vertices, and all edges are 5 centimeters (cm) long. What is the sum of the lengths of all the edges of this prism in centimeters (cm)?", "completion": "To find the sum of the lengths of all the edges of the prism, we need to know how many edges the prism has. Since the prism has 24 vertices, we can deduce that it is not a standard prism (like a triangular prism or a rectangular prism) because those have fewer vertices.\n\nHowever, we can use the Euler's formula for polyhedra to find the number of edges (E). Euler's formula states that for any convex polyhedron (which includes prisms), the number of vertices (V), the number of edges (E), and the number of faces (F) are related by the following formula:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe know V = 24 (the number of vertices). We need to find E (the number of edges). We don't know F (the number of faces), but we can deduce it if we know the shape of the prism. Since we don't have that information, we cannot directly use Euler's formula to find the number of edges.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the prism is a regular polyhedron (which is not stated but could be a reasonable assumption given the uniform edge length), the only regular polyhedron with 24 vertices is the truncated octahedron, which is an Archimedean solid, not a prism. The truncated octahedron has 36 edges.\n\nIf we assume that the prism is a truncated octahedron, then the sum of the lengths of all the edges would be:\n\nSum of edge lengths = Number of edges \u00d7 Length of each edge\nSum of edge lengths = 36 edges \u00d7 5 cm/edge\nSum of edge lengths = 180 cm\n\nSo, if the prism is a truncated octahedron, the sum of the lengths of all the edges would be 180 cm. However, without more specific information about the shape of the prism, we cannot definitively determine the sum of the lengths of all the edges."}
{"prompt": "Pillars are embedded at intervals of 30 meters (m) along the circular track.

So, if the track is 1 kilometer and 200 meters long, the total length in meters is:\n\n1 km = 1000 m\n200 m is already in meters.\n\nSo, the total length of the track in meters is 1000 m + 200 m = 1200 m.\n\nNow, we need to divide the total length of the track by the interval distance to find out how many pillars there are:\n\n1200 m / 30 m = 40\n\nTherefore, there are 40 pillars along the circular track."}

", "completion": "To find the minimum width of the wall needed to attach all the posters, we need to calculate the total width of the posters when they are placed side by side with an overlap of 2 cm.\n\nSince the posters are overlapping by 2 cm, each poster after the first one will contribute 30 cm - 2 cm = 28 cm to the total width.\n\nThe first poster will contribute its full width of 30 cm since it does not overlap with any poster on its left side.\n\nSo, for 15 posters, we have 1 poster contributing 30 cm and the remaining 14 posters contributing 28 cm each.\n\nThe total width required is:\n\\( Total width = Width of first poster + (Number of remaining posters \\times Overlapping width) \\)\n\\( Total width = 30 cm + (14 \\times 28 cm) \\)\n\\( Total width = 30 cm + 392 cm \\)\n\\( Total width = 422 cm \\)\n\nTherefore, the minimum width of the wall needed to attach all the posters is 422 centimeters."}

{"prompt": "27A8 minus 1203 is greater than 1022. How many digits from 0 to 9 can be written for A?", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to find the range of values for A such that the inequality 27A8 - 1203 > 1022 holds true.\n\nFirst, let's perform the subtraction without considering the value of A:\n\n27A8\n-1203\n------\n???\n\nSince we are subtracting 1203, we know that the last two digits of the result will be 8 - 3 = 5 and (A - 0) = A. So the result will look like 27A5.\n\nNow, let's set up the inequality with the result of the subtraction:\n\n27A5 > 1022\n\nTo find the minimum value for A, we need to ensure that 27A5 is just greater than 1022. The thousands digit in 1022 is 1, and in 27A5 it is 2, so we are already greater by at least 1000. We need to find the smallest A such that the number is still greater than 1022.\n\nThe hundreds digit in 1022 is 0, and in 27A5 it is 7, so no matter what A is, 27A5 will be greater than 1022 because 2700 is already greater than 1022.\n\nTherefore, A can be any digit from 0 to 9, and the inequality will still hold true. There are 10 possible digits (0-9) that A can be.\n\nSo the answer is 10 digits."}
{"prompt": "A and B are single-digit numbers. If A15B94 is a multiple of 99, find A+B.", "completion": "For a number to be a multiple of 99, it must be a multiple of both 9 and 11, since 99 is the product of these two prime factors.\n\nFirst, let's check the divisibility rule for 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. So, for the number A15B94 to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9:\n\nA + 1 + 5 + B + 9 + 4 = A + B + 19\n\nFor this sum to be a multiple of 9, A + B must be a number that, when added to 19, results in a multiple of 9. The smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 19 is 27, and the next one is 36. So, A + B could be 8 (27 - 19) or 17 (36 - 19). However, since A and B are single-digit numbers, A + B cannot be greater than 9 + 8 = 17. Therefore, A + B must be 8.\n\nNext, let's check the divisibility rule for 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd positions and the sum of its digits in the even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11. For the number A15B94, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is A + 5 + 9, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is 1 + B + 4. The difference between these sums must be a multiple of 11:\n\n(A + 5 + 9) - (1 + B + 4) = A + B + 10 - 5 = A + B + 5\n\nSince we've already determined that A + B = 8, we can substitute that into the equation:\n\n8 + 5 = 13\n\nThe difference is 13, which is not a multiple of 11. However, we can add or subtract multiples of 11 to get a number that is a multiple of 11. The closest multiple of 11 to 13 is 11 itself, and since 13 - 11 = 2, we can adjust our number to make the difference a multiple of 11. We can do this by changing the value of A or B to adjust the sum by 2.\n\nIf we decrease B by 2, the sum of the even positions would decrease by 2, making the difference a multiple of 11. Since A + B = 8, if B decreases by 2, A must increase by 2 to keep the sum at 8. However, since A and B are single-digit numbers, we cannot increase A beyond 9. Therefore, we must find a combination of A and B such that A + B = 8 and the difference between the sums of the odd and even positions is a multiple of 11.\n\nLet's try A = 1 and B = 7:\n\n(A + 5 + 9) - (1 + B + 4) = (1 + 5 + 9) - (1 + 7 + 4) = 15 - 12 = 3\n\nThe difference is 3, which is not a multiple of 11. Let's try increasing A and decreasing B:\n\nA = 2, B = 6:\n\n(A + 5 + 9) - (1 + B + 4) = (2 + 5 + 9) - (1 + 6 + 4) = 16 - 11 = 5\n\nStill not a multiple of 11. Let's continue:\n\nA = 3, B = 5:\n\n(A + 5 + 9) - (1 + B + 4) = (3 + 5 + 9) - (1 + 5 + 4) = 17 - 10 = 7\n\nNot a multiple of 11. Keep going:\n\nA = 4, B = 4:\n\n(A + 5 + 9) - (1 + B + 4) = (4 + 5 + 9) - (1 + 4 + 4) = 18 - 9 = 9\n\nNot a multiple of 11. Next:\n\nA = 5, B = 3:\n\n(A + 5 + 9) - (1 + B + 4) = (5 + 5 + 9) - (1 + 3 + 4) = 19 - 8 = 11\n\nThis works! The difference is 11, which is a multiple of 11. So, A = 5 and B = 3, and A + B = 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, A + B = 8, which we had already determined from the divisibility rule for 9. The number A15B94, with A = 5 and B = 3, is divisible by 99."}

{"prompt": "I put 30 tangerines, each weighing 0.36 kilograms (kg), in a gift box. At this moment, the weight of the gift box was 11.26 kilograms (kg). How many kilograms (kg) does an empty gift box weigh?", "completion": "To find the weight of the empty gift box, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tangerines.\n\nThe weight of one tangerine is 0.36 kg, so the weight of 30 tangerines is:\n\n30 tangerines * 0.36 kg/tangerine = 10.8 kg\n\nNow we know the total weight of the tangerines, we can subtract this from the total weight of the gift box with the tangerines to find the weight of the empty gift box.\n\nThe total weight of the gift box with the tangerines is 11.26 kg, so the weight of the empty gift box is:\n\n11.26 kg (total weight) - 10.8 kg (weight of tangerines) = 0.46 kg\n\nTherefore, the empty gift box weighs 0.46 kilograms."}

If the hare starts running 20 meters (m) behind the tortoise, in how many minutes will the hare and the tortoise meet?", "completion": "First, let's calculate the speed of the hare and the tortoise.\n\nThe tortoise covers 5 meters in 3 minutes, so its speed is:\nSpeed of tortoise = Distance / Time\nSpeed of tortoise = 5 m / 3 min\n\nThe hare covers 5 meters in 2 minutes, so its speed is:\nSpeed of hare = Distance / Time\nSpeed of hare = 5 m / 2 min\n\nNow, let's find out how much faster the hare is than the tortoise by subtracting the tortoise's speed from the hare's speed:\nRelative speed of hare to tortoise = Speed of hare - Speed of tortoise\nRelative speed of hare to tortoise = (5/2) m/min - (5/3) m/min\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case:\nRelative speed of hare to tortoise = (15/6) m/min - (10/6) m/min\nRelative speed of hare to tortoise = (15 - 10) / 6 m/min\nRelative speed of hare to tortoise = 5/6 m/min\n\nNow, we know the hare starts 20 meters behind the tortoise. We need to find out how long it will take for the hare to cover this 20-meter gap at the relative speed of 5/6 meters per minute.\n\nTime = Distance / Relative speed\nTime = 20 m / (5/6) m/min\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:\nTime = 20 m * (6/5) min/m\nTime = (20 * 6) / 5 min\nTime = 120 / 5 min\nTime = 24 min\n\nSo, it will take the hare 24 minutes to catch up to the tortoise."}

If we assume that the likelihood of a tourist from Seoul using their own car is the same as for the rest of the tourists, we can estimate the number of people who came by car from Seoul by taking the same proportion of Seoul tourists as the overall proportion of tourists who used their own cars.\n\nSo, we calculate:\n\nEstimated tourists by car from Seoul = 1/3 * 17523 = 5841\n\nTherefore, approximately 5841 people came to the cherry blossom festival by car from Seoul."}

According to the problem, Dongmin has 5 more candies than Kyuhyung, so Dongmin has \\( K + 5 \\) candies.\n\nThe sum of their candies is given as 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\( K + (K + 5) = 43 \\)\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\( 2K + 5 = 43 \\)\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n\\( 2K = 43 - 5 \\)\n\n\\( 2K = 38 \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 2 to solve for \\( K \\), we get:\n\n\\( K = \\frac{38}{2} \\)\n\n\\( K = 19 \\)\n\nSo, Kyuhyung has 19 candies."}
{"prompt": "To fill the fishbowl with water, you need to pour water 7 times with the A bowl, 8 times with the B bowl, and 5 times with the C bowl. Which bowl has the largest capacity?", "completion": "To determine which bowl has the largest capacity, we need to compare the number of times each bowl is used to fill the fishbowl. Fewer pours indicate a larger capacity since it takes less of that bowl to fill the fishbowl.\n\n- A bowl is used 7 times\n- B bowl is used 8 times\n- C bowl is used 5 times\n\nSince the C bowl is used only 5 times compared to the A bowl's 7 times and the B bowl's 8 times, it means that each pour from the C bowl contributes more volume to the fishbowl. Therefore, the C bowl has the largest capacity."}
{"prompt": "When 0, 2, and 4 are used once to make three-digit numbers, how many three-digit numbers can be formed?", "completion": "To form a three-digit number using the digits 0, 2, and 4, we need to consider that a three-digit number cannot start with 0 (as that would make it a two-digit number).\n\nSo, we have two choices for the first digit (2 or 4), three choices for the second digit (since after choosing the first digit, we still have two digits left and we can also use 0), and then two choices for the last digit (whichever two digits are left after choosing the first two).\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit numbers that can be formed is the product of the number of choices for each position:\n\n2 (choices for the first digit) \u00d7 2 (choices for the second digit) \u00d7 1 (choice for the third digit) = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 4\n\nSo, 4 different three-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 0, 2, and 4 without repetition."}

This can be written as:\n\nR - B = 12  (1)\n\nAccording to the second statement, the total number of marbles is 40 more than the difference between the number of red and blue marbles. The total number of marbles is R + B, so we can write:\n\nR + B = (R - B) + 40  (2)\n\nNow, let's substitute equation (1) into equation (2):\n\nR + B = 12 + 40\nR + B = 52  (3)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\nR - B = 12  (1)\nR + B = 52  (3)\n\nWe can solve this system by adding the two equations together to eliminate B:\n\n(1) + (3) gives us:\nR - B + R + B = 12 + 52\n2R = 64\nR = 32\n\nNow that we have the value of R, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find B:\n\n32 - B = 12\nB = 32 - 12\nB = 20\n\nNow we have the number of red marbles (R = 32) and the number of blue marbles (B = 20).

{"prompt": "In a park with a circumference of 1 kilometer (km) and 500 meters (m), trees are to be planted at intervals of 30 meters (m). If the cost of one tree is 5,000 mill, how much does it cost to buy the tree you need?", "completion": "First, we need to calculate the total distance around the park where the trees will be planted. The park has a circumference of 1 kilometer and 500 meters. Since 1 kilometer is equal to 1,000 meters, the total circumference in meters is:\n\n1 km = 1,000 m\n1 km + 500 m = 1,000 m + 500 m = 1,500 m\n\nNext, we need to determine how many trees will be planted at intervals of 30 meters along this 1,500-meter circumference. To find this, we divide the total distance by the interval distance:\n\n1,500 m / 30 m = 50 trees\n\nNow that we know 50 trees are needed, we can calculate the total cost. The cost of one tree is 5,000 mill. Since \"mill\" is a term that can refer to a currency unit, we'll assume it's the currency being used here. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of trees by the cost per tree:\n\n50 trees * 5,000 mill/tree = 250,000 mill\n\nTherefore, the cost to buy the trees needed is 250,000 mill."}

A color can be used only once.\n2. Adjacent areas must be painted with different colors.\n\nLet's denote the three parts as A, B, and C, and they are attached in a sequence (A-B-C). We have five colors to choose from: red (R), orange (O), blue (B), yellow (Y), and green (G).\n\nWe will start by choosing a color for part A. We have 5 options for this.\n\nOnce we have chosen a color for part A, we move on to part B. Since part B is adjacent to part A, it cannot be the same color as A. Therefore, we have 4 remaining options for part B.\n\nFinally, we choose a color for part C. Part C is adjacent to part B, so it cannot be the same color as B. However, it is not adjacent to part A, so it can be the same color as A. But since we are not allowed to use a color more than once, we have 3 remaining options for part C.\n\nThe total number of cases can be calculated by multiplying the number of options for each part:\n\nNumber of cases = Options for A * Options for B * Options for C\nNumber of cases = 5 * 4 * 3\nNumber of cases = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 60 different ways to paint the three parts A, B, and C with the given restrictions."}

How many times larger is the volume of Se-hee's box than the volume of Serin's box?", "completion": "First, let's calculate the volume of Se-hee's cube-shaped box. Since all sides of a cube are equal, and the side length is given as 1 meter, we can calculate the volume (V) using the formula for the volume of a cube:\n\nV_cube = side^3\n\nSince 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, we convert the side length to centimeters to match the units of Se-rin's box:\n\n1 meter = 100 centimeters\n\nV_cube = (100 cm)^3\nV_cube = 100 cm * 100 cm * 100 cm\nV_cube = 1,000,000 cubic centimeters (cm^3)\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume of Se-rin's cuboid-shaped box using the formula for the volume of a cuboid:\n\nV_cuboid = width * depth * height\n\nGiven the dimensions in centimeters:\n\nV_cuboid = 50 cm * 50 cm * 20 cm\nV_cuboid = 50,000 cubic centimeters (cm^3)\n\nFinally, to find out how many times larger Se-hee's box is compared to Se-rin's box, we divide the volume of Se-hee's box by the volume of Se-rin's box:\n\nVolume ratio = V_cube / V_cuboid\nVolume ratio = 1,000,000 cm^3 / 50,000 cm^3\nVolume ratio = 20\n\nSo, Se-hee's box is 20 times larger in volume than Se-rin's box."}

However, 720 is not a three-digit number, so we need to subtract another 360 to get a three-digit number.\n\n720 - 360 = 360\n\nBut 360 is not a three-digit number either, so we subtract one more 360:\n\n360 - 360 = 0\n\nThis means we've gone too far. The correct approach is to take the integer part of the division (which is 2) and multiply it by 360 to find the largest multiple of 360 that is less than 999.\n\n2 * 360 = 720\n\nSo, the largest three-digit number divisible by 6, 5, 8, and 9 is 720."}
{"prompt": "There is an icosagon. How many diagonals can be drawn from a vertex?", "completion": "An icosagon is a polygon with 20 sides. To find the number of diagonals that can be drawn from a single vertex, we need to consider that a diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices.\n\nFrom any given vertex in an icosagon, you cannot draw a diagonal to itself or to the two adjacent vertices (since those would be sides of the icosagon, not diagonals). Therefore, you can draw diagonals to the remaining 20 - 1 (for the vertex itself) - 2 (for the two adjacent vertices) = 17 vertices.\n\nSo, from any single vertex in an icosagon, you can draw 17 diagonals."}

{"prompt": "Find the number of odd numbers in a three-digit number that can be formed by using 5, 6, or 7 only once.", "completion": "To form a three-digit odd number using the digits 5, 6, or 7 only once, we need to ensure that the last digit (the units place) is an odd number, because that's what determines the parity of the entire number.\n\nThe possible odd digits we have are 5 and 7. So, we have two choices for the units place.\n\nFor the hundreds place, we can use any of the three digits (5, 6, or 7), but since we've already used one digit in the units place, we have 2 choices left for the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place, we only have one digit left, since we cannot repeat the digits and two have already been used in the hundreds and units places.\n\nSo, the total number of odd three-digit numbers we can form is the product of the number of choices for each place:\n\n2 (choices for units place) * 2 (choices for hundreds place) * 1 (choice for tens place) = 4 odd three-digit numbers."}

{"prompt": "Using the four number cards 0, 1, 4, and 8 once, find the number of three-digit numbers where the tens digit is zero.", "completion": "To form a three-digit number with the tens digit as zero, we need to place the '0' in the tens place. This leaves us with the hundreds and units places to fill with the remaining three numbers: 1, 4, and 8.\n\nFor the hundreds place, we can choose any of the three remaining numbers (1, 4, or 8). Once we choose a number for the hundreds place, we have two numbers left for the units place.\n\nSo, the number of three-digit numbers we can form with the tens digit as zero is the number of choices for the hundreds place multiplied by the number of choices for the units place.\n\nNumber of choices for hundreds place = 3 (1, 4, or 8)\nNumber of choices for units place = 2 (the remaining two numbers after choosing the hundreds place)\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit numbers we can form is:\n3 (choices for hundreds place) * 2 (choices for units place) = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 possible three-digit numbers where the tens digit is zero using the numbers 0, 1, 4, and 8 once."}

Since 7/18 of the audience wore glasses, we can calculate this number as follows:\n\nNumber of people wearing glasses = (7/18) * 1,260\n\nNow, let's find out how many people were not wearing glasses. Since the total number of seats is 1,260, the number of people without glasses is:\n\nNumber of people without glasses = Total number of seats - Number of people wearing glasses\nNumber of people without glasses = 1,260 - (7/18) * 1,260\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of the people without glasses were male. Since 6/11 of the people without glasses were male, we can calculate the number of males without glasses as follows:\n\nNumber of males without glasses = (6/11) * Number of people without glasses\nNumber of males without glasses = (6/11) * (1,260 - (7/18) * 1,260)\n\nNow, let's do the calculations:\n\nNumber of people wearing glasses = (7/18) * 1,260 = 7 * 70 = 490\n\nNumber of people without glasses = 1,260 - 490 = 770\n\nNumber of males without glasses = (6/11) * 770 = 6 * 70 = 420\n\nSo, there were 420 male audience members who were not wearing glasses."}

According to the information given, we have:\n\nB = R + 17  (since there are 17 more blue balls than red balls)\n\nMinsu then adds 57 blue balls and 18 red balls to the box, so we have:\n\nB + 57 (the new number of blue balls after Minsu's addition)\nR + 18 (the new number of red balls after Minsu's addition)\n\nMinsu then subtracts 44 balls from the box. We don't know how many of each color he subtracted, but the total number of balls removed is 44. So, the total number of balls in the box after all these changes is:\n\n(B + 57) + (R + 18) - 44\n\nAccording to the problem, after all these changes, there are 502 balls in total in the box. So we can set up the equation:\n\n(B + 57) + (R + 18) - 44 = 502\n\nNow, let's substitute B with R + 17 (from the first equation):\n\n(R + 17 + 57) + (R + 18) - 44 = 502\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2R + 17 + 57 + 18 - 44 = 502\n2R + 48 = 502\n\nSubtract 48 from both sides:\n\n2R = 502 - 48\n2R = 454\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to find R:\n\nR = 454 / 2\nR = 227\n\nNow that we have the number of red balls originally in the box (R = 227), we can find the number of blue balls originally in the box (B) using the first equation:\n\nB = R + 17\nB = 227 + 17\nB = 244\n\nSo, there were 244 blue balls in the box at the beginning."}

{"prompt": "When the 8.8 centimeters (cm) long block of wood was overlapped by 0.5 centimeters (cm), the total length of the connected block was 282.7 centimeters (cm). How many pieces of wood are there in total?", "completion": "To find the total number of pieces of wood, we need to determine the length of each piece when they are connected with an overlap of 0.5 cm.\n\nSince each block overlaps the next by 0.5 cm, the effective length added by each subsequent block is 8.8 cm - 0.5 cm = 8.3 cm.\n\nLet's call the total number of pieces of wood N. The first block contributes its full length of 8.8 cm, and each subsequent block adds 8.3 cm to the total length.\n\nSo the total length when N blocks are connected can be represented by the equation:\n\n8.8 cm + (N - 1) * 8.3 cm = 282.7 cm\n\nNow we solve for N:\n\n8.8 cm + 8.3 cm * (N - 1) = 282.7 cm\n8.3 cm * (N - 1) = 282.7 cm - 8.8 cm\n8.3 cm * (N - 1) = 273.9 cm\nN - 1 = 273.9 cm / 8.3 cm\nN - 1 \u2248 33\n\nNow we add 1 to find the total number of pieces:\n\nN \u2248 33 + 1\nN \u2248 34\n\nTherefore, there are approximately 34 pieces of wood in total."}

{"prompt": "I have made a cube with a side of 10 centimeters (cm) by stacking several blocks with a side of 2 centimeters (cm). If I paint all the faces of this cube red, how many blocks have only one coloured face?", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many blocks are on the surface of the larger cube and have only one face painted.\n\nThe larger cube has a side length of 10 cm, and each small block has a side length of 2 cm. To find out how many small blocks fit along one edge of the larger cube, we divide the side length of the larger cube by the side length of the small block:\n\n10 cm / 2 cm = 5 blocks\n\nSo, each edge of the larger cube has 5 small blocks. Since the larger cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square consisting of 5x5 small blocks, the total number of blocks on the surface of the larger cube is:\n\n6 faces * (5 blocks * 5 blocks) = 6 * 25 = 150 blocks\n\nHowever, not all of these blocks have only one face painted. The blocks on the edges and corners of the cube have more than one face painted. We need to subtract these from the total to find the number of blocks with only one face painted.\n\nEach edge of the cube has 5 blocks, but the corner blocks are shared between two edges, so we should count them only once for now. There are 4 edges on each face, but we have 4 corner blocks on each face that we should not double count. So, for each face, the number of edge blocks (excluding corners) is:\n\n(5 blocks per edge * 4 edges) - 4 corner blocks = 20 - 4 = 16 blocks\n\nSince there are 6 faces, the total number of edge blocks (excluding corners) on the cube is:\n\n16 blocks per face * 6 faces = 96 blocks\n\nNow, we have to subtract the corner blocks. There are 8 corners on the cube, and each corner block has 3 faces painted, so we don't count them in the blocks with only one face painted.\n\nFinally, to find the number of blocks with only one face painted, we subtract the edge blocks (excluding corners) and the corner blocks from the total number of surface blocks:\n\n150 surface blocks - 96 edge blocks (excluding corners) = 54 blocks\n\nSo, there are 54 blocks with only one face painted red."}

We need to find the length of the upper side (base2).\n\nLet's denote the length of the upper side as base2. Plugging in the values we have into the formula:\n\n286 cm\u00b2 = (1/2) * (25 cm + base2) * 13 cm\n\nTo solve for base2, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2 * 286 cm\u00b2 = (25 cm + base2) * 13 cm\n\n572 cm\u00b2 = (25 cm + base2) * 13 cm\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 13 cm to isolate the term with base2:\n\n572 cm\u00b2 / 13 cm = 25 cm + base2\n\n44 cm = 25 cm + base2\n\nNow, we subtract 25 cm from both sides to solve for base2:\n\n44 cm - 25 cm = base2\n\n19 cm = base2\n\nTherefore, the length of the upper side (base2) of the trapezoid is 19 centimeters."}

Therefore, the total number of vases in the square arrangement is \\( x^2 \\).\n\nSince there were 6 bottles left after arranging them in a square, the total number of vases is \\( x^2 + 6 \\).\n\nWhen you tried to increase the width and length by one row each, you attempted to create a new square with side length \\( x + 1 \\). The total number of vases needed for this new arrangement would be \\( (x + 1)^2 \\).\n\nHowever, you were 11 vases short for this new arrangement, so the total number of vases you have is \\( (x + 1)^2 - 11 \\).\n\nSince both expressions represent the total number of vases you have, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 6 = (x + 1)^2 - 11 \\]\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 6 = x^2 + 2x + 1 - 11 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation by subtracting \\( x^2 \\) from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 6 = 2x - 10 \\]\n\nAdding 10 to both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 16 = 2x \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, there are 8 vases in one row of the original square arrangement.\n\nNow, you mentioned that if you arrange these vases in 7 rows, we want to find out how many vases there are in 1 row.

If you arrange these 70 vases in 7 rows, to find the number of vases in 1 row, we divide the total number of vases by the number of rows:\n\n\\[ \\frac{70}{7} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 10 vases in 1 row when arranged in 7 rows."}

There are 10 tiles on each side of the square, but the corner tiles are counted on two sides. So, to avoid double-counting the corner tiles, we calculate the perimeter tiles as follows:\n\n- There are 4 corner tiles (one for each corner).\n- Each side without the corners has 10 - 2 = 8 tiles (since we subtract the 2 corners).\n- There are 4 sides, so the number of non-corner perimeter tiles is 8 x 4 = 32 tiles.\n\nAdding the corner tiles, we have 32 + 4 = 36 blue tiles on the perimeter.\n\nNow, to find the number of yellow tiles, we subtract the number of blue tiles from the total number of tiles:\n\n100 total tiles - 36 blue tiles = 64 yellow tiles.\n\nTherefore, there are 64 yellow tiles on the inside of the large square."}

To find the smallest three-digit multiple of 20, we can divide 100 by 20 and then take the ceiling of the result to find the next whole number multiple:\n\n100 \u00f7 20 = 5 (remainder 0)\n\nSince 100 is already a multiple of 20, the smallest three-digit multiple of 20 is 100.\n\nThe largest three-digit number is 999, but it is not a multiple of 20. To find the largest three-digit multiple of 20, we can divide 999 by 20 and then take the floor of the result to find the previous whole number multiple:\n\n999 \u00f7 20 = 49 (remainder 19)\n\nThe largest whole number multiple of 20 before 999 is 49 \u00d7 20 = 980.\n\nNow, we need to count how many multiples of 20 there are between 100 and 980 inclusive. We can do this by subtracting the smallest multiple from the largest multiple and then dividing by 20, and finally adding 1 to include both endpoints:\n\n(980 - 100) \u00f7 20 + 1 = 880 \u00f7 20 + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45\n\nTherefore, there are 45 three-digit numbers that are common multiples of 4 and 5."}

So we can write the equation:\n\n(x / 2) / 2 = 85 + 45\n\nFirst, let's simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n85 + 45 = 130\n\nNow our equation looks like this:\n\n(x / 2) / 2 = 130\n\nTo solve for x, we need to undo the division by 2 twice. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, twice:\n\n(x / 2) * 2 = 130 * 2\nx = 260 * 2\nx = 520\n\nNow we have the value of x, which is 520. The problem asks for the value of subtracting 45 from the number, so we simply subtract 45 from x:\n\n520 - 45 = 475\n\nTherefore, the value of subtracting 45 from the number is 475."}

{"prompt": "Hyungjun drinks 200 milliliters (ml) of Coke every day, which contains 2 liters (L). How many days will it take him to finish drinking Coke if he has been drinking Coke for 3 days?", "completion": "First, we need to convert the 2 liters of Coke to milliliters because the daily consumption is given in milliliters. \n\n1 liter is equivalent to 1000 milliliters. Therefore, 2 liters is equivalent to 2 * 1000 ml = 2000 ml.\n\nHyungjun drinks 200 ml of Coke every day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish 2000 ml, we divide the total amount by the daily consumption:\n\n2000 ml / 200 ml/day = 10 days\n\nSince he has already been drinking for 3 days, we subtract those days from the total days needed:\n\n10 days - 3 days = 7 days\n\nIt will take Hyungjun 7 more days to finish drinking the Coke."}
{"prompt": "How many three-digit integers can be made by drawing 3 cards from 1 through 4?", "completion": "To form a three-digit integer using the cards 1 through 4, we can use each card only once since there is only one of each card. The three-digit integer can be any arrangement of the three cards.\n\nFor the first digit (the hundreds place), we have 4 choices (1, 2, 3, or 4).\nFor the second digit (the tens place), we have 3 remaining choices since we cannot repeat the digit already used in the hundreds place.\nFor the third digit (the ones place), we have 2 remaining choices since we cannot repeat the digits used in the hundreds and tens places.\n\nTo find the total number of three-digit integers that can be formed, we multiply the number of choices for each place:\n\n4 (choices for the first digit) \u00d7 3 (choices for the second digit) \u00d7 2 (choices for the third digit) = 24\n\nSo, 24 different three-digit integers can be made by drawing 3 cards from 1 through 4."}

However, each edge of the hexagonal bases is shared with a rectangular face, so we only need to count the vertical edges that are not part of the hexagonal bases. There are 6 of these vertical edges, one for each side of the hexagon.\n\nThe length of each vertical edge is equal to the height of the prism, which is 11 cm.\n\nSo, the sum of the lengths of all the edges is:\n\nLength of hexagonal base edges: 6 cm/side * 12 sides = 72 cm\nLength of vertical edges: 11 cm/edge * 6 edges = 66 cm\n\nTotal length of all edges = 72 cm + 66 cm = 138 cm\n\nTherefore, the sum of the lengths of all the edges of the prism is 138 centimeters."}

{"prompt": "There are 6/5 and 1/10. What is their sum?", "completion": "To find the sum of 6/5 and 1/10, we need to add the two fractions together. However, before we can do that, we need to make sure that the fractions have a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators of the two fractions are 5 and 10. The least common denominator (LCD) for these two fractions is 10 because 10 is the smallest number that both 5 and 10 can divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nNow, we need to convert the fraction 6/5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 10. To do this, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\n6/5 = (6 * 2) / (5 * 2) = 12/10\n\nNow that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add them together:\n\n12/10 + 1/10 = (12 + 1) / 10 = 13/10\n\nTherefore, the sum of 6/5 and 1/10 is 13/10, which can also be written as 1 3/10 in mixed number form."}

This is a classic problem of combinations with repetition, also known as \"stars and bars\" or \"balls and urns.\"\n\nThe formula for combinations with repetition is given by:\n\nC(n + k - 1, k)\n\nwhere n is the number of items to distribute (34 pairs of shoes) and k is the number of recipients (2 students).\n\nSo we have:\n\nC(34 + 2 - 1, 2 - 1) = C(35, 1)\n\nThe number of combinations of 35 items taken 1 at a time is simply 35.\n\nTherefore, there are 35 ways to distribute the 36 pairs of shoes to two different female students, ensuring that each girl receives at least one pair of shoes."}

For the number to round down to 8000, A must be in the range of 0 to 4.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for A are: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThere are 5 possible values for A."}
{"prompt": "There is a machine that produces 15 liters (l) of coke in 3 minutes at a constant rate. How many minutes does it take to get 140 liters (l) of Coke?", "completion": "To find out how many minutes it takes to get 140 liters of Coke, we can set up a proportion based on the rate at which the machine produces Coke.\n\nWe know that the machine produces 15 liters in 3 minutes. So, we can write the following proportion:\n\n15 liters / 3 minutes = 140 liters / x minutes\n\nNow we can solve for x, which represents the number of minutes it takes to produce 140 liters:\n\n(15 liters / 3 minutes) * x minutes = 140 liters\n15x = 140 * 3\n15x = 420\n\nNow, divide both sides by 15 to solve for x:\n\nx = 420 / 15\nx = 28\n\nSo, it takes 28 minutes to produce 140 liters of Coke."}

{"prompt": "Six years ago, when Sunkyung added her and her mother's ages, it was 48. This year, Sunkyung's mother is said to be three times older than Sunkyung. How old is her mother?", "completion": "Let's denote Sunkyung's age six years ago as S and her mother's age six years ago as M. According to the information given:\n\nS + M = 48  (Equation 1)\n\nNow, let's consider their ages today. Since six years have passed, Sunkyung's current age would be S + 6 and her mother's current age would be M + 6.\n\nAccording to the second piece of information, Sunkyung's mother is currently three times older than Sunkyung. Therefore:\n\nM + 6 = 3(S + 6)  (Equation 2)\n\nNow, let's solve these equations. First, we'll expand Equation 2:\n\nM + 6 = 3S + 18\n\nNow, we'll isolate M:\n\nM = 3S + 18 - 6\nM = 3S + 12  (Equation 3)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (Equation 1 and Equation 3). We can substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:\n\nS + (3S + 12) = 48\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n4S + 12 = 48\n\nNow, we'll solve for S:\n\n4S = 48 - 12\n4S = 36\nS = 36 / 4\nS = 9\n\nNow that we have Sunkyung's age six years ago, we can find her mother's age six years ago using Equation 1:\n\n9 + M = 48\nM = 48 - 9\nM = 39\n\nSo, Sunkyung's mother was 39 years old six years ago. To find her current age, we add 6 years:\n\n39 + 6 = 45\n\nTherefore, Sunkyung's mother is currently 45 years old."}

Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, the perimeter P is simply the sum of all three sides:\n\nP = 3 * (side length of the triangle)\nP = 3 * (20/9 cm)\nP = 60/9 cm\nP = 20/3 cm\n\nNow, we know that the regular pentagon has the same perimeter as the equilateral triangle. A regular pentagon has five equal sides, so if we divide the perimeter of the pentagon by 5, we will find the length of one side.\n\nLet's call the side length of the pentagon s. The perimeter of the pentagon is also 20/3 cm, so:\n\n5s = 20/3 cm\n\nTo find s, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\ns = (20/3 cm) / 5\ns = (20/3) * (1/5) cm\ns = 20/15 cm\ns = 4/3 cm\n\nTherefore, the side length of the regular pentagon is 4/3 cm."}

{"prompt": "Subtracting 7/3 from a number equals 3/2. What is the result if you add 7/3 to that number?", "completion": "Let's call the number we're looking for \"x\". According to the problem, subtracting 7/3 from x gives us 3/2:\n\nx - 7/3 = 3/2\n\nTo find x, we need to add 7/3 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx - 7/3 + 7/3 = 3/2 + 7/3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 3/2 + 7/3\n\nTo add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 2 and 3 is 6. So we convert each fraction:\n\n3/2 = 9/6 (because 3 * 3 = 9 and 2 * 3 = 6)\n7/3 = 14/6 (because 7 * 2 = 14 and 3 * 2 = 6)\n\nNow we can add them:\n\nx = 9/6 + 14/6\nx = (9 + 14) / 6\nx = 23/6\n\nSo the number we're looking for is 23/6. Now, if we add 7/3 to that number:\n\n23/6 + 7/3\n\nAgain, we need a common denominator, which is still 6. We convert 7/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 6:\n\n7/3 = 14/6\n\nNow we add them:\n\n23/6 + 14/6 = (23 + 14) / 6\n= 37/6\n\nSo the result of adding 7/3 to the number is 37/6."}

Since 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, we can convert 4 kilometers to meters:\n\n4 km = 4 * 1000 m = 4000 m\n\nNow, we add the 436 meters to this distance to get the total distance from the entrance to the temple:\n\n4000 m + 436 m = 4436 m\n\nNext, we add the distance from the temple to the top of the mountain:\n\n4436 m + 1999 m = 6435 m\n\nThis is the distance Seokgi walked to get from the entrance to the top of the mountain. Since he came down the same road, we need to double this distance:\n\n6435 m * 2 = 12870 m\n\nFinally, we convert this distance back to kilometers.

If 20 pieces of fabric each 10 centimeters (cm) long are sewn together and the length of the joint is 5 millimeters (mm), how many centimeters (cm) is the length of the piece of fabric sewn together?", "completion": "First, let's convert the length of the joint from millimeters to centimeters, since the length of the fabric pieces is given in centimeters. There are 10 millimeters in 1 centimeter, so 5 millimeters is equal to 0.5 centimeters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total length of the fabric without considering the joints:\n\n20 pieces * 10 cm/piece = 200 cm\n\nNext, we need to account for the length lost to the joints. Since there are 20 pieces of fabric, there will be 19 joints (because the first piece doesn't need a joint at its beginning and the last piece doesn't need a joint at its end).\n\n19 joints * 0.5 cm/joint = 9.5 cm\n\nNow, subtract the total length of the joints from the total length of the fabric:\n\n200 cm - 9.5 cm = 190.5 cm\n\nSo, the length of the piece of fabric sewn together is 190.5 centimeters."}

So, the price of the boat is Y + 1,500 won.\n\nSince the price of the boat is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\nS + 2,000 = Y + 1,500\n\nWe also know that when they combine their money, they have 3,500 won left after buying the boat. So, the total money they have together is the price of the boat plus 3,500 won. Therefore:\nS + Y = (Price of the boat) + 3,500\n\nWe already established that the price of the boat can be represented as S + 2,000 or Y + 1,500.

{"prompt": "If you add -5/12 and subtract -5/2 from a number, it becomes 1/3. What is the number?", "completion": "Let's call the number we are looking for \"x\". According to the problem, if we add -5/12 to x and then subtract -5/2 from the result, we get 1/3. We can write this as an equation:\n\nx + (-5/12) - (-5/2) = 1/3\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by removing the parentheses and remembering that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive:\n\nx - 5/12 + 5/2 = 1/3\n\nNow, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions so that we can combine them. The least common denominator (LCD) for 12, 2, and 3 is 12. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 12:\n\nx - 5/12 + (5/2) * (6/6) = (1/3) * (4/4)\n\nx - 5/12 + 30/12 = 4/12\n\nNow we can combine the fractions:\n\nx + (30/12 - 5/12) = 4/12\n\nx + 25/12 = 4/12\n\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 25/12 from both sides:\n\nx = 4/12 - 25/12\n\nx = (-21/12)\n\nNow we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\nx = (-21 \u00f7 3) / (12 \u00f7 3)\n\nx = -7/4\n\nSo the number we are looking for is -7/4."}

{"prompt": "There is a prism with a sum of the number of vertices, faces, and corners is 50. How many edges of the pyramid have the same base shape as the prism?", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to use Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states that for any convex polyhedron:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n\nV + F + C = 50\n\nHowever, the term \"corners\" is a bit ambiguous, as corners typically refer to vertices in the context of polyhedra. Assuming that \"corners\" is a mistaken term and should be \"edges\" (E), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nV + E + F = 50\n\nNow, let's use Euler's formula to find the relationship between V, E, and F for the prism:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for E:\n\nE = V + F - 2\n\nSince we know that V + E + F = 50, we can substitute E in the above equation:\n\nE = (50 - E) - 2\n\nNow, let's solve for E:\n\nE = 50 - E - 2\n2E = 48\nE = 24\n\nSo, the prism has 24 edges.\n\nNow, let's find the number of edges of the pyramid that has the same base shape as the prism. A pyramid has one less edge on the base than the prism because the base of the pyramid is the same as one of the faces of the prism, and the rest of the edges of the pyramid come from the vertices of the base to the apex.\n\nLet's denote the number of edges on the base of the prism as B. Since a prism has two congruent bases, the total number of edges on the bases of the prism is 2B. The remaining edges of the prism are the ones that connect the corresponding vertices of the two bases, which is equal to the number of vertices on one base (also B).\n\nSo, for the prism, we have:\n\nE (total edges of prism) = 2B (edges on bases) + B (vertical edges)\n24 = 2B + B\n24 = 3B\nB = 24 / 3\nB = 8\n\nThe base of the prism has 8 edges, which means the base is an octagon.\n\nNow, for the pyramid with an octagonal base, the number of edges will be the number of edges on the base (8) plus the number of edges from the vertices of the base to the apex (also 8, since there is one edge from each vertex of the base to the apex).\n\nTherefore, the pyramid has 8 (base edges) + 8 (edges to apex) = 16 edges."}

{"prompt": "It takes 0.84 meters (m) of ribbon tape to make one ribbon. If 50 centimeters (cm) remain after making 10 ribbons with the ribbon tape that Yujin has, find the length in meters (m) of the ribbon tape that Yujin had at first.", "completion": "First, we need to convert the remaining ribbon tape from centimeters to meters to keep the units consistent. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so 50 centimeters is equal to 0.50 meters.\n\nYujin used a certain length of ribbon tape to make 10 ribbons, with each ribbon requiring 0.84 meters. So the total length of ribbon tape used for 10 ribbons is:\n\n10 ribbons * 0.84 meters/ribbon = 8.4 meters\n\nAfter making 10 ribbons, Yujin has 0.50 meters of ribbon tape left. To find the original length of the ribbon tape, we add the length used to make the ribbons to the length remaining:\n\n8.4 meters (used for ribbons) + 0.50 meters (remaining) = 8.9 meters\n\nTherefore, Yujin originally had 8.9 meters of ribbon tape."}
{"prompt": "A cube has an edge length of 3 centimeters (cm).

The volume of a cube is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ V = a^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the edge length of the cube. So for the original cube:\n\n\\[ V_{original} = 3^3 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\text{ cm}^3 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the volume of the smaller cube that is being cut out. It has an edge length of 1 cm, so its volume is:\n\n\\[ V_{small} = 1^3 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\text{ cm}^3 \\]\n\nA cube has 6 faces, so if we cut out a small cube from each face, we will cut out 6 small cubes in total. The total volume of the small cubes cut out is:\n\n\\[ V_{cut} = 6 \\times V_{small} = 6 \\times 1 \\text{ cm}^3 = 6 \\text{ cm}^3 \\]\n\nFinally, to find the volume of the remaining part of the original cube after the small cubes have been cut out, we subtract the total volume of the small cubes from the volume of the original cube:\n\n\\[ V_{remaining} = V_{original} - V_{cut} = 27 \\text{ cm}^3 - 6 \\text{ cm}^3 = 21 \\text{ cm}^3 \\]\n\nSo the volume of the remaining part of the cube is 21 cm\u00b3."}

Since each small bag weighs 220 grams, the total weight of the 9 small bags is:\n\n9 small bags * 220 grams/bag = 1980 grams\n\nNext, we need to add the weight of the larger bag to the total weight of the small bags:\n\n1980 grams (9 small bags) + 250 grams (larger bag) = 2230 grams\n\nNow, let's subtract the weight of all the bags from the total weight to find the total weight of the gifts:\n\n13300 grams (total weight) - 2230 grams (weight of bags) = 11070 grams (weight of gifts)\n\nSince there are 6 gifts in each small bag and there are 9 small bags, the total number of gifts is:\n\n6 gifts/small bag * 9 small bags = 54 gifts\n\nFinally, we can find the weight of each gift by dividing the total weight of the gifts by the total number of gifts:\n\n11070 grams (weight of gifts) / 54 gifts = 205 grams/gift\n\nTherefore, each gift weighs 205 grams."}
{"prompt": "There are three pyramids (a), (b), and (c). Given that the sum of the vertices of the three pyramids is 40, what is the sum of the edges of these pyramids?", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that a pyramid has a base that is a polygon and triangular faces that meet at a common vertex (the apex).\n\nLet's denote the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a pyramid as V, E, and F, respectively.\n\nFor any pyramid:\n- The number of edges (E) is equal to the number of base edges plus the number of sides (which is also the number of vertices of the base), because each side edge connects a base vertex to the apex.\n- The number of vertices (V) is equal to the number of base vertices plus 1 (for the apex).\n\nSo, for any pyramid, we have:\nE = base edges + base vertices\nV = base vertices + 1\n\nSince we are given that the sum of the vertices of the three pyramids is 40, we can write:\nV(a) + V(b) + V(c) = 40\n\nUsing the relationship between vertices and edges for each pyramid, we can express the edges of each pyramid in terms of its vertices:\nE(a) = V(a) - 1 + (V(a) - 1)\nE(b) = V(b) - 1 + (V(b) - 1)\nE(c) = V(c) - 1 + (V(c) - 1)\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the edges of the three pyramids:\nE(a) + E(b) + E(c) = (V(a) - 1 + V(a) - 1) + (V(b) - 1 + V(b) - 1) + (V(c) - 1 + V(c) - 1)\nE(a) + E(b) + E(c) = 2V(a) - 2 + 2V(b) - 2 + 2V(c) - 2\nE(a) + E(b) + E(c) = 2(V(a) + V(b) + V(c)) - 6\nE(a) + E(b) + E(c) = 2(40) - 6\nE(a) + E(b) + E(c) = 80 - 6\nE(a) + E(b) + E(c) = 74\n\nTherefore, the sum of the edges of the three pyramids is 74."}

According to the division algorithm, when a number A is divided by another number B, it can be expressed as:\n\nA = B * Q + R\n\nwhere Q is the quotient and R is the remainder.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\nQ = 28 (the quotient when A is divided by B)\nR = 4 (the remainder when A is divided by B)\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible value of A that satisfies this equation. Since we are looking for the smallest A, we should consider the smallest possible value of B that still gives a remainder of 4 when A is divided by it. The smallest B can be is 1 (since B is a natural number and natural numbers start from 1), but that would not give us a remainder of 4. The next smallest B would be 5, which would give us a remainder of 4 when A is divided by it (since 5 - 1 = 4).\n\nSo, let's try B = 5 and see if it satisfies the equation:\n\nA = B * Q + R\nA = 5 * 28 + 4\nA = 140 + 4\nA = 144\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of A that satisfies the given conditions is 144."}

So, the discount amount per device is:\n\n800,000 won - 450,000 won = 350,000 won\n\nNow, we know that the total discount you received is 16.45 million won. To find out how many devices you bought, we divide the total discount by the discount per device:\n\n16,450,000 won / 350,000 won/device = 47 devices\n\nSo, you bought 47 electronic devices."}
{"prompt": "Yoongi bought a 200-page book and read 12 pages each day for two weeks. Find out how many pages Yoongi has not read.", "completion": "To find out how many pages Yoongi has not read, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has read over the two weeks.\n\nYoongi reads 12 pages each day. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 2 x 7 = 14 days.\n\nIf he reads 12 pages each day for 14 days, then he has read a total of 12 x 14 = 168 pages.\n\nThe book has 200 pages in total. To find out how many pages he has not read, we subtract the number of pages he has read from the total number of pages in the book:\n\n200 - 168 = 32 pages\n\nSo, Yoongi has not read 32 pages of the book."}
{"prompt": "Jungkook's fruit shop sells 4 types of fruit. How many ways can you choose to buy two?", "completion": "To determine the number of ways you can choose to buy two types of fruit from four available, you can use the combination formula which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / [k! * (n - k)!]\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items to choose from (in this case, 4 types of fruit),\n- k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 types of fruit),\n- \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number (e.g., 4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24).\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / [2! * (4 - 2)!]\nC(4, 2) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / [(2 \u00d7 1) * (2 \u00d7 1)]\nC(4, 2) = (24) / [(2) * (2)]\nC(4, 2) = 24 / 4\nC(4, 2) = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 different ways you can choose to buy two types of fruit from the four available at Jungkook's fruit shop."}

So, we subtract the number of male rabbits from the total number of rabbits to find the number of female rabbits:\n\n24 total rabbits - 15 male rabbits = 9 female rabbits\n\nTherefore, there are 9 female rabbits."}
{"prompt": "Shinyoung ate 1/3 of the pizza, Seokgi 1/4, and Woong 1/5. Who ate the most pizza?", "completion": "To determine who ate the most pizza, we need to compare the fractions that represent the portions of pizza each person ate.\n\nShinyoung ate 1/3 of the pizza.\nSeokgi ate 1/4 of the pizza.\nWoong ate 1/5 of the pizza.\n\nTo compare these fractions, it's helpful to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 3, 4, and 5 is 60. We can convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 60 to compare them more easily:\n\nShinyoung: \\( \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 20}{3 \\times 20} = \\frac{20}{60} \\)\nSeokgi: \\( \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1 \\times 15}{4 \\times 15} = \\frac{15}{60} \\)\nWoong: \\( \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1 \\times 12}{5 \\times 12} = \\frac{12}{60} \\)\n\nNow we can clearly see that Shinyoung ate \\( \\frac{20}{60} \\) of the pizza, Seokgi ate \\( \\frac{15}{60} \\), and Woong ate \\( \\frac{12}{60} \\). Since \\( \\frac{20}{60} \\) is the largest fraction, Shinyoung ate the most pizza."}
{"prompt": "When the six-digit number A4461B is divisible by 72, find A+B.", "completion": "For a number to be divisible by 72, it must be divisible by both 8 and 9, since 72 is the product of these two numbers (72 = 8 * 9).\n\nLet's first check the divisibility rule for 9:\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the number A4461B:\nA + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + B = A + B + 15\n\nFor the sum to be a multiple of 9, A + B + 15 must be divisible by 9. The smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 15 is 18, but since A and B are digits, their maximum sum is 9 + 9 = 18. Therefore, A + B + 15 must be at least 18 and at most 27 (the next multiple of 9). Since 15 is already a part of the sum, A + B must be 3 (to make the sum 18) or 12 (to make the sum 27).\n\nNow let's check the divisibility rule for 8:\nA number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the number A4461B:\nThe last three digits are 61B. We need to find a value for B such that 61B is divisible by 8.\n\nLet's try the possible values for B (0 to 9) and see which one makes 61B divisible by 8:\n610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619\n\nOut of these, 616 is divisible by 8 (since 8 * 77 = 616). Therefore, B must be 6.\n\nNow we know B = 6, let's find A:\nIf A + B + 15 must be 18 or 27, and B is 6, then A + 6 + 15 must be 18 or 27.\n\nFor the sum to be 18:\nA + 6 + 15 = 18\nA + 21 = 18\nA = 18 - 21\nA = -3 (which is not possible since A is a digit)\n\nFor the sum to be 27:\nA + 6 + 15 = 27\nA + 21 = 27\nA = 27 - 21\nA = 6\n\nSo, A is also 6.\n\nNow we can find A + B:\nA + B = 6 + 6 = 12\n\nTherefore, A + B equals 12."}

We are given the width (24 cm) and the length to width ratio (0.875). We can use the ratio to find the length.\n\nThe ratio of length to width is 0.875, which means that the length is 0.875 times the width. So, we can calculate the length as follows:\n\nLength = Width * Ratio\nLength = 24 cm * 0.875\nLength = 21 cm\n\nNow that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the area of the rectangle:\n\nArea = Length * Width\nArea = 21 cm * 24 cm\nArea = 504 cm\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 504 square centimeters."}

Since A, B, C, and D are single-digit numbers, we can use the properties of subtraction to find their values.\n\nLet's start by looking at the units place (the rightmost digit):\n\nB - 9 = 3 (since we are subtracting 9 from B and getting 3, we must have borrowed 1 from the tens place, so B must be 3 + 9 + 10 = 22, which is not possible as B is a single-digit number. So we must have borrowed 1 from the tens place, making B = 3 + 9 = 12, which is still not possible. So we must have borrowed another 1 from the hundreds place, making B = 3 + 9 + 10 = 22 - 10 = 12, which is still not possible. So we must have borrowed yet another 1 from the thousands place, making B = 3 + 9 + 10 = 22 - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2).\n\nNow, let's look at the tens place:\n\n0 (borrowed 1, so it's effectively 10) - 0 = 9 (since we are subtracting 0 from 10 and getting 9, we must have borrowed 1 from the hundreds place, so the tens place is effectively 10 - 1 = 9).\n\nNow, let's look at the hundreds place:\n\n0 (borrowed 1, so it's effectively 10) - C = D (since we are subtracting C from 10 and getting D, and we know that the tens place is 9, we can deduce that C must be 1 and D must be 9).\n\nFinally, let's look at the thousands place:\n\nA - 5 = 1 (since we are subtracting 5 from A and getting 1, A must be 6).\n\nSo, we have A = 6, B = 2, C = 1, and D = 9.\n\nThe sum of A, B, C, and D is 6 + 2 + 1 + 9 = 18."}

{"prompt": "If the three-digit natural number 7AB is a multiple of 7, how many numbers are possible to become two-digit natural number AB?", "completion": "To find out how many two-digit numbers AB are possible such that 7AB is a multiple of 7, we need to check each two-digit number AB from 10 to 99 and see if appending a 7 in front of it (to make it 7AB) results in a number that is divisible by 7.\n\nLet's start by checking the smallest two-digit number, which is 10. If we append 7 in front of it, we get 710. Now we need to check if 710 is divisible by 7. We can do this by performing the division or by using divisibility rules for 7.\n\nLet's use the divisibility rule for 7: Double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7.\n\nFor 710:\n1. Double the last digit (0) to get 0.\n2. Subtract it from the rest of the number (71 - 0 = 71).\n3. Check if 71 is divisible by 7. It is not, so 710 is not divisible by 7.\n\nWe would need to repeat this process for each two-digit number AB from 10 to 99 and count how many times 7AB is divisible by 7.\n\nHowever, there is a more efficient way to do this. Since we are looking for multiples of 7, we can start with the smallest three-digit multiple of 7 that starts with 7, which is 700, and then keep adding 7 until we reach the largest three-digit number starting with 7, which is 799.\n\nLet's do this:\n\n700 is divisible by 7 (it's 7 * 100).\nThe next multiple of 7 would be 700 + 7 = 707.\nContinuing this process, we add 7 each time until we reach or exceed 799.\n\nThe numbers we get are: 700, 707, 714, 721, ..., 799.\n\nTo find out how many numbers there are, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:\n\nNumber of terms = (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1\n\nIn this case:\nLast term = 799 (the last three-digit number starting with 7 that is a multiple of 7)\nFirst term = 700 (the first three-digit number starting with 7 that is a multiple of 7)\nCommon difference = 7 (since we are adding 7 each time)\n\nNumber of terms = (799 - 700) / 7 + 1\nNumber of terms = 99 / 7 + 1\nNumber of terms = 14 + 1\nNumber of terms = 15\n\nSo there are 15 possible two-digit numbers AB such that 7AB is a multiple of 7."}

{"prompt": "There is a square piece of land with a side length of 4 kilometers (km). A rhombus-shaped park was created by connecting the points that divided the four sides of the land into two equally. Find the area of the park.", "completion": "To find the area of the rhombus-shaped park, we first need to determine the lengths of its diagonals. Since the park is created by connecting the points that divide the four sides of the square land into two equally, each point is 2 km from the nearest corner of the square.\n\nThe diagonals of the rhombus are the lines that connect opposite points. Since the square has a side length of 4 km, the diagonals of the rhombus will each be equal to the length of the square's side, which is 4 km.\n\nThe area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (d1 * d2) / 2\n\nwhere d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nIn this case, both d1 and d2 are 4 km, so the area of the park is:\n\nArea = (4 km * 4 km) / 2\nArea = (16 km^2) / 2\nArea = 8 km^2\n\nTherefore, the area of the rhombus-shaped park is 8 square kilometers."}

{"prompt": "When writing the numbers 1 through 125 on the board, how many times is the number 2 used?", "completion": "To find out how many times the number 2 is used when writing the numbers from 1 to 125, we can break it down into different place values: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. Units place: The digit 2 will appear in the units place once every 10 numbers (2, 12, 22, 32, ..., 122). Since there are 125 numbers, and the pattern repeats every 10 numbers, there will be 12 complete sets of 10 with a 2 in the units place, plus one extra (122). So, there are 12 + 1 = 13 occurrences of the number 2 in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 2 will also appear in the tens place once every 100 numbers (20-29, 120-125). There are 10 occurrences in the first set (20-29) and 6 occurrences in the second set (120-125), for a total of 10 + 6 = 16 occurrences of the number 2 in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 2 will appear in the hundreds place for all numbers from 200 to 299. However, since we are only counting up to 125, the digit 2 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nAdding up the occurrences from all place values, we get 13 (units) + 16 (tens) = 29 times that the number 2 is used when writing the numbers from 1 to 125."}

So we have:\n\nA = 8B + C\nA = 8x + x (since B = C = x)\nA = 9x\n\nSince A, B, and C are natural numbers, x must also be a natural number. The largest value of A would be the largest value of x that still allows C to be less than 8 (because the remainder must be less than the divisor when doing division).\n\nThe largest possible remainder when dividing by 8 is 7. Therefore, the largest value for x (which is equal to the remainder C) is 7.\n\nSo the largest A would be:\n\nA = 9x\nA = 9 * 7\nA = 63\n\nTherefore, the largest number A, when divided by 8, gives a quotient and remainder that are equal, is 63."}

The number must be a multiple of 4.\n2. When the number is divided by 3, the remainder must be 1.\n\nLet's first find the numbers that are multiples of 4 up to 100:\n\n4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100\n\nNow, let's check which of these numbers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.

{"prompt": "Willow trees are planted at 30-meter (m) intervals along the circular pond. If the circumference of the pond is 1 kilometer (km) and 200 meters (m), how many willow trees were planted in all?", "completion": "First, we need to convert the circumference of the pond to meters since the interval at which the willow trees are planted is given in meters. \n\n1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. So, if the circumference is 1 kilometer and 200 meters, it would be:\n\n1 km = 1000 m\n200 m is already in meters.\n\nSo the total circumference in meters is 1000 m + 200 m = 1200 m.\n\nNow, if the willow trees are planted at 30-meter intervals along this circumference, we can find out how many trees there are by dividing the total circumference by the interval distance:\n\n1200 m / 30 m/tree = 40 trees\n\nTherefore, 40 willow trees were planted around the pond."}

To find the weight per meter, we divide the total weight by the total length:\nWeight per meter (doll) = Total weight (doll) / Total length (doll)\nWeight per meter (doll) = (29/8) kg / 5 m\nWeight per meter (doll) = (29/8) * (1/5) kg/m\nWeight per meter (doll) = 29/40 kg/m\n\nThe tree is 4 meters long and weighs 2.8 kilograms. To find the weight per meter, we divide the total weight by the total length:\nWeight per meter (tree) = Total weight (tree) / Total length (tree)\nWeight per meter (tree) = 2.8 kg / 4 m\nWeight per meter (tree) = 0.7 kg/m\n\nNow, let's find the weight of a 2-meter section of both the doll and the tree:\n\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = Weight per meter (doll) * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = (29/40) kg/m * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (doll) = 29/20 kg\n\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = Weight per meter (tree) * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = 0.7 kg/m * 2 m\nWeight of 2-meter section (tree) = 1.4 kg\n\nFinally, let's add the weights of the 2-meter sections together:\n\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = Weight of 2-meter section (doll) + Weight of 2-meter section (tree)\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29/20) kg + 1.4 kg\n\nTo add these together, we need to convert 1.4 kg to a fraction with the same denominator as 29/20, which is 20:\n\n1.4 kg = 1.4 * (20/20) kg\n1.4 kg = (1.4 * 20) / 20 kg\n1.4 kg = 28/20 kg\n\nNow we can add the two fractions:\n\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29/20) kg + (28/20) kg\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = (29 + 28) / 20 kg\nTotal weight of 2-meter sections = 57/20 kg\n\nTo convert this to a mixed number, we divide 57 by 20:\n\n57 \u00f7 20 = 2 with a remainder of 17\n\nSo, 57/20 kg is equal to 2 kg and 17/20 kg.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the 2-meter sections of the doll and the tree together is 2 kg and 17/20 kg."}

{"prompt": "How many three-digit integers can be created by pressing 3 of the 6 buttons on a calculator with the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 on them?", "completion": "To create a three-digit integer, we need to select 3 different numbers from the 6 available (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and arrange them in a sequence where the first digit cannot be 0 (since that would make it a two-digit number).\n\nFirst, we select 3 different numbers from the 6 available. This can be done in \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\) ways, which is the number of combinations of 6 things taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\), where \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of n.\n\nSo, \\( \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 \\) ways.\n\nNow, for each of these combinations, we need to arrange them into a three-digit number. However, we must remember that the first digit cannot be 0. So, for each combination, we have two cases:\n\n1. If the combination includes the number 0, we have 2 choices for the first digit (any of the other two numbers), and then 2 choices for the second digit (the remaining number or 0), and finally 1 choice for the last digit (whichever number is left). This gives us \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4 \\) arrangements for each combination that includes 0.\n\n2. If the combination does not include the number 0, we have 3 choices for the first digit, 2 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. This gives us \\( 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\) arrangements for each combination that does not include 0.\n\nTo find out how many of the 20 combinations include the number 0, we can calculate it as follows: We have 1 choice for the number 0, and then we need to choose 2 more numbers from the remaining 5 numbers. This can be done in \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\) ways.\n\n\\( \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\) ways.\n\nSo, there are 10 combinations that include the number 0, and each of these can be arranged in 4 ways, giving us \\( 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\) three-digit numbers.\n\nThe remaining \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) combinations do not include the number 0, and each of these can be arranged in 6 ways, giving us \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\) three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding these together, we get \\( 40 + 60 = 100 \\) three-digit integers that can be created by pressing 3 of the 6 buttons on the calculator."}

{"prompt": "If there are 6 people A, B, C, D, E, and F, find the number of ways to select 2 subjects and 1 king.", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to consider two separate selections: choosing 2 subjects and choosing 1 king.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to select 2 subjects from the 6 people. This is a combination problem since the order in which we select the subjects does not matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the total number of items to choose from,\n- k is the number of items to choose,\n- \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nFor selecting 2 subjects from 6 people, we have:\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!)\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!)\nC(6, 2) = (6 * 5 * 4!) / (2 * 1 * 4!)\nC(6, 2) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\nC(6, 2) = 30 / 2\nC(6, 2) = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to select 2 subjects from 6 people.\n\nNext, we need to select 1 king from the remaining 4 people (since 2 have already been chosen as subjects). This is a simple selection problem, and there are 4 ways to choose 1 king from 4 people.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to select 2 subjects and 1 king, we multiply the number of ways to select the subjects by the number of ways to select the king:\n\nTotal ways = Ways to select subjects * Ways to select king\nTotal ways = 15 * 4\nTotal ways = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 60 different ways to select 2 subjects and 1 king from 6 people."}

Let's denote the average excluding E as AvgExclE and the average excluding A as AvgExclA. We have:\n\nAvgExclA - AvgExclE = 6\n\nSince AvgExclA is the average of B, C, D, and E, and AvgExclE is the average of A, B, C, and D, we can write:\n\n(AvgExclA * 4) - (AvgExclE * 4) = 24\n\nNow, AvgExclA * 4 is the sum of B, C, D, and E, and AvgExclE * 4 is the sum of A, B, C, and D.

Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, his bowl holds a total of 1000 milliliters + 500 milliliters = 1500 milliliters (or 1.5 liters) per scoop.\n\nSo, the total amount of water Heungbu fetched is:\n3 scoops * 1.5 liters/scoop = 4.5 liters\n\nHeungbu's wife scooped up water once with a bowl that holds 1 liter and 750 milliliters. This is equal to 1 liter + 0.75 liters = 1.75 liters.\n\nSo, the total amount of water fetched by Heungbu and his wife together is:\n4.5 liters (Heungbu) + 1.75 liters (wife) = 6.25 liters\n\nNow, let's find out how much water is left to fetch to reach the 10 liters goal:\n10 liters (total needed) - 6.25 liters (already fetched) = 3.75 liters\n\nHeungbu's son has a bowl that holds 1 liter and 250 milliliters, which is equal to 1.25 liters.\n\nTo find out how many times Heungbu's son needs to visit the well, we divide the remaining amount of water by the capacity of his bowl:\n3.75 liters / 1.25 liters/bowl = 3 times\n\nHeungbu's son needs to visit the well 3 times to fetch all the remaining water."}

So, the surface area of one face is:\n\n20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm\u00b2\n\nSince there are 6 faces on a cube, the total surface area of the cube is:\n\n6 * 400 cm\u00b2 = 2400 cm\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the box is 2400 square centimeters."}
{"prompt": "You have a candle that is 25 centimeters (cm) long. If this candle burns 1.75 centimeters (cm) in 10 minutes, how many minutes after lighting will it be 11 centimeters (cm) long?", "completion": "To find out how many minutes it will take for the candle to be 11 centimeters long, we first need to determine how much of the candle will have burned away.\n\nThe candle starts at 25 centimeters and needs to be reduced to 11 centimeters. So, the amount of candle that will have burned away is:\n\n25 cm - 11 cm = 14 cm\n\nNow we know that the candle burns at a rate of 1.75 centimeters every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals it takes to burn 14 centimeters, we divide the total amount to be burned by the rate of burning:\n\n14 cm / 1.75 cm per 10 minutes = 8 intervals of 10 minutes\n\nNow we multiply the number of intervals by the time per interval to find the total time:\n\n8 intervals * 10 minutes per interval = 80 minutes\n\nSo, it will take 80 minutes for the candle to be 11 centimeters long after lighting."}

After dividing by 8, Minjin has A/8 apples.\n3. Seongyeong gives Minjin 8 apples, so now Minjin has A/8 + 8 apples.\n4. Bong-Geon takes 30 apples, so Minjin is left with A/8 + 8 - 30 apples.\n5. The remaining apples, when multiplied by 6, equal 12: 6 * (A/8 + 8 - 30) = 12.\n\nNow, let's solve for A:\n\n6 * (A/8 + 8 - 30) = 12\nA/8 + 8 - 30 = 12 / 6\nA/8 + 8 - 30 = 2\nA/8 = 2 + 30 - 8\nA/8 = 24\nA = 24 * 8\nA = 192\n\nMinjin had 192 apples at the beginning."}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to make a square as small as possible by arranging rectangular tiles that are 12 centimeters (cm) wide and 15 centimeters (cm) tall without any overlap. How many tiles will you need in total?", "completion": "To make a square using rectangular tiles that are 12 cm wide and 15 cm tall, we need to find a common multiple of the two dimensions that will give us the side length of the square. The smallest square that can be formed will have a side length that is a common multiple of both 12 cm and 15 cm.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15 can be found by prime factorization:\n\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n15 = 3 * 5\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of both numbers:\n\nLCM(12, 15) = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60 cm\n\nSo, the side length of the smallest square we can make with these tiles is 60 cm.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many tiles are needed to cover this square:\n\nArea of the square = side length * side length = 60 cm * 60 cm = 3600 cm\u00b2\n\nArea of one tile = width * height = 12 cm * 15 cm = 180 cm\u00b2\n\nNumber of tiles needed = Area of the square / Area of one tile = 3600 cm\u00b2 / 180 cm\u00b2 = 20 tiles\n\nTherefore, you will need 20 tiles in total to make the smallest square possible without any overlap."}
{"prompt": "I am trying to create a three-digit number using 0, 1, 3, and 5. If each number can be used only once, find out the sum of the smallest number and the largest possible number.", "completion": "To create the smallest possible three-digit number using the digits 0, 1, 3, and 5, we need to ensure that the smallest non-zero digit is in the hundreds place, the next smallest in the tens place, and the next in the ones place. Since 0 cannot be in the hundreds place (as that would make it a two-digit number), we will use 1 as the smallest non-zero digit for the hundreds place. The next smallest digit is 0, which we will place in the tens place, and then 3 in the ones place. So, the smallest number we can create is 103.\n\nTo create the largest possible three-digit number, we need to place the largest digit in the hundreds place, the next largest in the tens place, and the smallest in the ones place. The largest digit we have is 5, so we'll place that in the hundreds place. The next largest is 3, which we'll place in the tens place, and then 1 in the ones place (since we cannot use 0 as it would not increase the value of the number). So, the largest number we can create is 531.\n\nNow, we find the sum of the smallest and largest numbers:\n\nSmallest number = 103\nLargest number = 531\n\nSum = 103 + 531 = 634\n\nTherefore, the sum of the smallest and largest possible numbers is 634."}

{"prompt": "While traveling, Seonwoo drank 1/2 of the water he had on the first day, 1/3 of the remaining water on the second day, and 1/2 of the remaining water on the third day, leaving him with 250 milliliters (ml). How many milliliters (ml) did Seonwoo have at first?", "completion": "Let's denote the initial amount of water Seonwoo had as W milliliters.\n\nOn the first day, he drank 1/2 of W, so he had 1/2 * W left.\n\nOn the second day, he drank 1/3 of the remaining water, which is 1/3 * (1/2 * W) = 1/6 * W. So after the second day, he had (1/2 * W) - (1/6 * W) left.\n\nTo combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case. So we convert 1/2 * W to 3/6 * W. Now we can subtract:\n\n(3/6 * W) - (1/6 * W) = (3 - 1)/6 * W = 2/6 * W = 1/3 * W.\n\nOn the third day, he drank 1/2 of the remaining water, so he had 1/2 * (1/3 * W) left, which is 1/6 * W.\n\nWe know that after the third day, he had 250 ml left, which is equal to 1/6 * W:\n\n1/6 * W = 250 ml\n\nTo find the initial amount of water W, we multiply both sides of the equation by 6:\n\nW = 250 ml * 6\nW = 1500 ml\n\nSo Seonwoo had 1500 milliliters of water at first."}

{"prompt": "Seokgi and Yeseul shared a wire. The length of this wire is 1 meter (m) and 50 centimeters (cm), and it is said that the Seokgi's share is 16 centimeters (cm) shorter than Yeseul. How many centimeters (cm) of wire does Seokgi have?", "completion": "First, let's convert the total length of the wire into centimeters. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, a wire that is 1 meter and 50 centimeters long is:\n\n1 meter = 100 centimeters\n50 centimeters = 50 centimeters\nTotal length in centimeters = 100 cm + 50 cm = 150 cm\n\nNow, let's denote Yeseul's share of the wire as Y and Seokgi's share as S. According to the information given, Seokgi's share is 16 centimeters shorter than Yeseul's share. This can be written as:\n\nS = Y - 16 cm\n\nSince the total length of the wire is 150 cm, we can also say:\n\nY + S = 150 cm\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) S = Y - 16 cm\n2) Y + S = 150 cm\n\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation to find the length of Yeseul's share:\n\nY + (Y - 16 cm) = 150 cm\n2Y - 16 cm = 150 cm\n2Y = 150 cm + 16 cm\n2Y = 166 cm\nY = 166 cm / 2\nY = 83 cm\n\nNow that we know Yeseul's share is 83 cm, we can find Seokgi's share by subtracting 16 cm from Yeseul's share:\n\nS = Y - 16 cm\nS = 83 cm - 16 cm\nS = 67 cm\n\nTherefore, Seokgi has 67 centimeters of wire."}

How many centimeters (cm) is the length of one side of the square?", "completion": "To find the length of one side of the square, we first need to calculate the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length of one side by the length of the adjacent side. \n\nFor Jungwoo's rectangle, the sides are 9 cm and 16 cm, so the area is:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\nArea = 9 cm \u00d7 16 cm\nArea = 144 cm\u00b2\n\nSince the square has the same area as the rectangle, the area of the square is also 144 cm\u00b2. \n\nThe area of a square is found by squaring the length of one of its sides (since all sides of a square are equal in length). Let's call the length of the side of the square 's'. \n\nArea of square = s\u00b2\n\nWe know the area is 144 cm\u00b2, so:\n\ns\u00b2 = 144 cm\u00b2\n\nTo find the length of the side 's', we take the square root of the area:\n\ns = \u221a144 cm\u00b2\ns = 12 cm\n\nTherefore, the length of one side of the square is 12 centimeters."}

So, we just need to find the LCM of 5 and 8.\n\nThe prime factorization of 5 is 5 (since it's a prime number), and the prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 (since 8 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2).\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of each number. In this case, the LCM is 5 \u00d7 2^3 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest three-digit number that is a multiple of 40. To do this, we divide the largest three-digit number, 999, by 40 and find the quotient and remainder.\n\n999 \u00f7 40 = 24 with a remainder of 39.\n\nThis means that 999 is not a multiple of 40, but if we subtract the remainder from 999, we will get the largest multiple of 40 that is a three-digit number.\n\n999 - 39 = 960.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit number divisible by 5, 8, and 2 is 960."}

{"prompt": "How many two-digit integers can be formed by drawing two of the three flags with the numbers 3, 4, and 5 on them?", "completion": "To form a two-digit integer, we need to select two different flags from the three available, one for the tens place and one for the units place. \n\nThe number of ways to choose two flags out of three is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items to choose from (in this case, 3 flags), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 flags), and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 flags out of 3 is:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3 - 2)!)\nC(3, 2) = (3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 1)\nC(3, 2) = 3\n\nHowever, for each pair of flags chosen, there are 2 ways to arrange them to form a two-digit number (AB or BA).

{"prompt": "If the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 13 and the length of a non-hypotenuse is 12, what is the length of the other side?", "completion": "To find the length of the other side of the right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). The formula is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nGiven that the length of the hypotenuse (c) is 13 and the length of one non-hypotenuse side (a) is 12, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the length of the other non-hypotenuse side (b):\n\nb^2 = c^2 - a^2\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nb^2 = 13^2 - 12^2\nb^2 = 169 - 144\nb^2 = 25\n\nTo find the length of side b, take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = \u221a25\nb = 5\n\nTherefore, the length of the other non-hypotenuse side of the right triangle is 5 units."}

What is the length of the radius of the circumscribed circle?", "completion": "The circumscribed circle around a right triangle is also known as the circumcircle. The radius of this circle is called the circumradius. For a right triangle, the circumradius (R) can be found using the formula:\n\nR = hypotenuse / 2\n\nIn a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, which is opposite the right angle. In this case, we have three sides: 10 cm, 8 cm, and 6 cm. To determine which side is the hypotenuse, we need to check if the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides.\n\nLet's check if 10 cm is the hypotenuse:\n\n8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100\n10^2 = 100\n\nSince 100 = 100, the side measuring 10 cm is indeed the hypotenuse.\n\nNow we can use the formula to find the circumradius:\n\nR = hypotenuse / 2\nR = 10 cm / 2\nR = 5 cm\n\nThe length of the radius of the circumscribed circle around this right triangle is 5 centimeters."}

{"prompt": "There are 7/10 of the air left in the 10 liter (L) bag. How many liters (liters) of air would we need to put in each bag if we wanted to divide this air equally among 4 bags?", "completion": "First, let's find out how much air is currently in the 10-liter bag. Since there are 7/10 of the air left in the bag, we multiply 10 liters by 7/10:\n\n10 liters * 7/10 = 7 liters\n\nNow, we have 7 liters of air that we want to divide equally among 4 bags. To find out how much air to put in each bag, we divide the total amount of air by the number of bags:\n\n7 liters / 4 bags = 1.75 liters per bag\n\nSo, we would need to put 1.75 liters of air into each of the 4 bags to divide the air equally."}
{"prompt": "There are four numbers A, B, C, and D. Find C from the four-digit addition formula 4A5B+C2D7=8070.", "completion": "To solve for C in the four-digit addition formula 4A5B + C2D7 = 8070, we need to align the numbers according to their place values and add them up. Let's write down the addition with the digits aligned:\n\n```\n  4A5B\n+ C2D7\n-------\n  8070\n```\n\nNow, let's look at the units place (the rightmost digit). We have B + 7 = 0 (since the last digit of the sum is 0). This is only possible if B = 3 and we have a carryover of 1 to the next column (the tens place), because 3 + 7 = 10.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. We have 5 + D + 1 (carryover) = 7. Since we already have a carryover of 1, we need to find a D such that 5 + D + 1 = 7. This means D must be 1, because 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\nNow, let's look at the hundreds place. We have A + 2 = 0 (since the third digit of the sum is 0). This is only possible if A = 8 and we have a carryover of 1 to the next column (the thousands place), because 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nFinally, let's look at the thousands place. We have 4 + C + 1 (carryover) = 8. This means C must be 3, because 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the value of C is 3."}

{"prompt": "Kyu-yeon and Na-eun are going to share 12 liters (L) and 400 milliliters (\u3396) of apple juice for a week. If Kyu-yeon drank 2 liters (L) and 600 meters (m) liters (L) more than Na-eun when comparing the amount of apple juice she drank in a week, how many liters (L) of apple juice did Kyu-yeon drink?", "completion": "First, let's convert the total amount of apple juice into the same unit. Since we are asked to find out how many liters Kyu-yeon drank, we will convert the milliliters to liters.\n\n1 liter (L) = 1000 milliliters (\u3396)\n\nSo, 400 milliliters (\u3396) is equal to 400 / 1000 = 0.4 liters (L).\n\nNow, let's add this to the total liters of apple juice:\n\n12 liters (L) + 0.4 liters (L) = 12.4 liters (L)\n\nThis is the total amount of apple juice that Kyu-yeon and Na-eun are going to share.\n\nNow, let's address the mistake in the question. It seems there is a typo with \"600 meters (m) liters (L).\" It should probably be \"600 milliliters (\u3396)\" instead of \"600 meters (m).\" Let's convert 600 milliliters to liters:\n\n600 milliliters (\u3396) = 600 / 1000 = 0.6 liters (L)\n\nAccording to the question, Kyu-yeon drank 2 liters (L) and 0.6 liters (L) more than Na-eun.\n\nLet's denote the amount Na-eun drank as N liters. Then Kyu-yeon drank N + 2 + 0.6 liters.\n\nSince they shared the juice equally, we can write the equation:\n\nN (Na-eun's amount) + (N + 2 + 0.6) (Kyu-yeon's amount) = 12.4 liters (total amount)\n\n2N + 2.6 = 12.4\n\nNow, let's solve for N:\n\n2N = 12.4 - 2.6\n2N = 9.8\n\nN = 9.8 / 2\nN = 4.9 liters\n\nThis is the amount Na-eun drank. Now, let's find out how much Kyu-yeon drank:\n\nKyu-yeon's amount = N + 2 + 0.6\nKyu-yeon's amount = 4.9 + 2 + 0.6\nKyu-yeon's amount = 7.5 liters\n\nSo, Kyu-yeon drank 7.5 liters of apple juice."}

{"prompt": "You found two round-shaped jewels in the cave. A gem A is 10 centimeters (cm) in diameter, and the other gem B is 4 centimeters (cm) in radius. The larger size is more expensive. If you're going to bring something more expensive, what should you bring?", "completion": "To determine which gem is larger, and therefore more expensive, we need to compare their sizes. Since both gems are round-shaped, we can compare their diameters.\n\nGem A has a diameter of 10 cm.\n\nGem B has a radius of 4 cm, which means its diameter is twice the radius, so the diameter of Gem B is 4 cm * 2 = 8 cm.\n\nSince Gem A has a larger diameter (10 cm) than Gem B (8 cm), Gem A is the larger and more expensive gem. Therefore, you should bring Gem A if you're looking for the more expensive option."}
{"prompt": "Two people try to share 20 apples. If you say every person should have at least one, how many ways are there?", "completion": "If two people are sharing 20 apples and each person must have at least one apple, we can think of this as a problem of distributing the remaining 18 apples after giving each person one apple to start with.\n\nLet's call the two people A and B. We have already given each person one apple, so we have 18 apples left to distribute. The number of ways to distribute these apples can be thought of as the number of ways to divide 18 into two groups (since each group represents the additional number of apples each person will get).\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\nA + B = 18\n\nWhere A and B represent the additional number of apples each person will get. Since A and B can take any value from 0 to 18 (inclusive), we can think of this as placing 18 indistinguishable objects (apples) into 2 distinguishable boxes (people).\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the formula for combinations with repetition, which is:\n\n(Number of items + Number of boxes - 1) choose (Number of boxes - 1)\n\nIn this case, we have 18 items (apples) and 2 boxes (people), so the formula becomes:\n\n(18 + 2 - 1) choose (2 - 1) = 19 choose 1\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 item from 19 is simply 19.\n\nTherefore, there are 19 ways to distribute the remaining 18 apples between two people if each person must have at least one apple."}

{"prompt": "Find the area of a square whose diagonal is 12 centimeters (cm).", "completion": "To find the area of a square when given the length of the diagonal, we can use the following relationship:\n\nThe diagonal of a square divides the square into two congruent right-angled triangles. In each of these triangles, the legs are the sides of the square, and the diagonal is the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's denote the side of the square as \"s\" and the diagonal as \"d\". According to the Pythagorean theorem, for a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, we have:\ns^2 + s^2 = d^2\n\nSince both legs are equal (because it's a square), we can combine the terms:\n2s^2 = d^2\n\nNow, we can solve for s^2:\ns^2 = d^2 / 2\n\nGiven that the diagonal (d) is 12 cm, we can substitute this value into the equation:\ns^2 = (12 cm)^2 / 2\ns^2 = 144 cm^2 / 2\ns^2 = 72 cm^2\n\nNow that we have the value of s^2, we can find the area of the square (A) by using the formula A = s^2:\nA = 72 cm^2\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 72 square centimeters."}

For the second digit, we can use any of the 5 cards, including 0, because the second digit can be 0.\n\nHowever, since we are drawing cards and not replacing them, we have one less choice for the second digit after choosing the first. So, after choosing the first digit, we have 4 remaining choices for the second digit.\n\nTherefore, the number of two-digit integers we can form is the product of the number of choices for the first and second digits:\n\n4 (choices for the first digit) * 4 (choices for the second digit) = 16 two-digit integers."}

{"prompt": "You made 5 identical rectangles by cutting a square-shaped paper whose side is 40 centimeters (cm) long. How many centimeters (cm) is the length of the shorter side of a rectangle when it has the largest area?", "completion": "To maximize the area of the rectangles, we need to cut the square in such a way that the rectangles are as large as possible. Since we are making 5 identical rectangles, we have a few options on how to cut the square. We can cut the square into 5 strips either along its length or its width.\n\nThe area of the square is \\(40 \\text{ cm} \\times 40 \\text{ cm} = 1600 \\text{ cm}^2\\). When we divide this area by 5 to get the area of each rectangle, we get \\(1600 \\text{ cm}^2 / 5 = 320 \\text{ cm}^2\\) for each rectangle.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible ways to cut the square to create the rectangles:\n\n1. Cut the square into 5 strips along its length (40 cm side). Each strip would then have a length of 40 cm and a width of \\(40 \\text{ cm} / 5 = 8 \\text{ cm}\\). The area of each rectangle would be \\(40 \\text{ cm} \\times 8 \\text{ cm} = 320 \\text{ cm}^2\\), which matches our calculated area for each rectangle.\n\n2. Cut the square into 5 strips along its width (40 cm side). This would result in the same dimensions as the first option, with each rectangle having a length of 40 cm and a width of 8 cm.\n\nSince the question asks for the length of the shorter side of the rectangle when it has the largest area, and we've determined that the area is maximized when the rectangles are cut along the length or width of the square, the length of the shorter side of the rectangle is 8 cm."}
{"prompt": "The area of a quadrilateral whose all four sides are equal is 21.46 square centimeters (cm2).

The area of a square is given by the formula:\n\nArea = side^2\n\nGiven the area of the square is 21.46 cm\u00b2, we can find the length of one side (s) by taking the square root of the area:\n\ns = \u221aArea\ns = \u221a21.46\ns \u2248 4.63 cm\n\nNow, since the quadrilateral is a square, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other at 90 degrees, forming two right-angled triangles within the square. Each triangle has two sides of length s (the sides of the square) and the hypotenuse is the diagonal of the square.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for one of these right-angled triangles, we have:\n\n(diagonal/2)^2 = s^2 + s^2\n(diagonal/2)^2 = 2 * s^2\n(diagonal/2)^2 = 2 * (4.63)^2\n(diagonal/2)^2 = 2 * 21.4369\n(diagonal/2)^2 = 42.8738\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the half diagonal:\n\ndiagonal/2 = \u221a42.8738\ndiagonal/2 \u2248 6.55 cm\n\nSince this is half the diagonal, we multiply by 2 to find the full length of the diagonal:\n\ndiagonal \u2248 6.55 * 2\ndiagonal \u2248 13.1 cm\n\nHowever, we are given that one of the diagonals is 7.4 cm, which means the square is not a square but a rhombus (a quadrilateral with all sides equal but not necessarily all angles 90 degrees). In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles but are not necessarily equal.\n\nWe can use the area of the rhombus and the length of one diagonal to find the length of the other diagonal. The area of a rhombus can also be calculated by the formula:\n\nArea = (d1 * d2) / 2\n\nwhere d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. We can rearrange this formula to solve for d2:\n\nd2 = (Area * 2) / d1\n\nGiven the area is 21.46 cm\u00b2 and one diagonal (d1) is 7.4 cm, we can find the other diagonal (d2):\n\nd2 = (21.46 * 2) / 7.4\nd2 = 42.92 / 7.4\nd2 \u2248 5.8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other diagonal is approximately 5.8 cm."}

We are told that the route going down is 2 km longer than the route going up, so:\n\n\\[ d_{down} = d_{up} + 2 \\]\n\nUsing the relationship between speed, distance, and time, we can express the time taken to go up and down in terms of distance:\n\n\\[ t_{up} = \\frac{d_{up}}{3} \\]\n\\[ t_{down} = \\frac{d_{down}}{4} \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( d_{down} \\) in terms of \\( d_{up} \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ t_{down} = \\frac{d_{up} + 2}{4} \\]\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (\\( t_{up} \\) and \\( d_{up} \\)). We can substitute \\( t_{up} \\) and \\( t_{down} \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d_{up}}{3} + \\frac{d_{up} + 2}{4} = 4 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( d_{up} \\), we need to find a common denominator and combine the fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4d_{up}}{12} + \\frac{3(d_{up} + 2)}{12} = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4d_{up} + 3d_{up} + 6}{12} = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ 7d_{up} + 6 = 48 \\]\n\n\\[ 7d_{up} = 42 \\]\n\n\\[ d_{up} = 6 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( d_{up} \\), we can find \\( t_{up} \\):\n\n\\[ t_{up} = \\frac{d_{up}}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ t_{up} = \\frac{6}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ t_{up} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, it took Gyeonghun 2 hours to go up the mountain."}
{"prompt": "When submarines can go down into the sea at 3.8 kilometers (km) per hour, find how deep the submarine can descend for 2 hours and 45 minutes in kilometers (km). (Given that it descends at a constant speed without any stop.)", "completion": "First, we need to convert the time from hours and minutes to just hours to make the calculation easier. We have 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 2 hours + 45 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 45 minutes is 45/60 hours.\n\n45 minutes = 45/60 hours\n45 minutes = 0.75 hours\n\nNow we have a total time of 2 hours + 0.75 hours = 2.75 hours.\n\nThe submarine can descend at a rate of 3.8 kilometers per hour. To find out how deep it can go in 2.75 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:\n\nDepth = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDepth = 3.8 km/hour \u00d7 2.75 hours\n\nNow we calculate the depth:\n\nDepth = 10.45 km\n\nSo, the submarine can descend to a depth of 10.45 kilometers in 2 hours and 45 minutes."}

Since the width of the paper is 20 cm, the largest square we can make from the width will also have a side length of 20 cm, because if we try to make the squares any larger, they would not fit within the 20 cm width.\n\nNow, we need to check if we can get three squares of 20 cm by 20 cm from the length of the paper, which is 54 cm. To do this, we multiply the side length of the square by 3 (since we want three squares):\n\n20 cm * 3 = 60 cm\n\nHowever, 60 cm is greater than the length of the paper, which is 54 cm. This means we cannot make three squares of 20 cm by 20 cm from the paper.\n\nTherefore, we need to consider the length of the paper, which is 54 cm, and divide it by 3 to get the largest possible square that can fit three times along the length:\n\n54 cm / 3 = 18 cm\n\nEach side of the largest possible square must be 18 cm to make three equal-sized squares from the rectangular paper."}

{"prompt": "There is one black go stone and two white go stones. How many ways are there to place 3 go stones in a row?", "completion": "To determine the number of ways to place 3 Go stones in a row, we need to consider the different permutations of the stones. Since we have 1 black stone (B) and 2 white stones (W1, W2), we can treat the white stones as distinct for the purpose of counting and then divide by the permutations of the identical items (the white stones) to get the correct count.\n\nThe permutations of the three stones, treating the white stones as distinct, are as follows:\n\n1. B W1 W2\n2. B W2 W1\n3. W1 B W2\n4. W1 W2 B\n5. W2 B W1\n6. W2 W1 B\n\nSince the two white stones are actually identical, each arrangement that is different only by the swapping of the two white stones is actually the same arrangement. Therefore, we divide the total number of permutations by the number of permutations of the two identical white stones, which is 2! (2 factorial) or 2.\n\nSo the number of unique ways to place the stones is 6 (permutations treating white stones as distinct) / 2 (permutations of the identical white stones) = 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 unique ways to place 3 Go stones in a row with the given configuration of stones."}

{"prompt": "A cuboid space can contain 36 boxes, each measuring 1 centimeter (cm) in length, width, and height. How many boxes could fit in this space if you double its length, width, and height?", "completion": "If the original cuboid space can contain 36 boxes, each measuring 1 cm in length, width, and height, then the volume of the original space is 36 cubic centimeters (since each box is 1 cm\u00b3).\n\nIf you double the length, width, and height of the cuboid space, the new dimensions will be 2 times the original dimensions.\n\nLet's assume the original dimensions of the cuboid space are L cm in length, W cm in width, and H cm in height. The volume of the original space is L * W * H = 36 cm\u00b3.\n\nWhen you double each dimension, the new length is 2L, the new width is 2W, and the new height is 2H. The volume of the new space is (2L) * (2W) * (2H).\n\nThe new volume is 2^3 times the original volume because you have doubled each of the three dimensions. So the new volume is 2^3 * 36 cm\u00b3 = 8 * 36 cm\u00b3 = 288 cm\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, if you double the length, width, and height of the original space, you can fit 288 boxes, each measuring 1 cm in length, width, and height."}
{"prompt": "Wheel A makes 10 revolutions in 2 minutes and Wheel B makes 7 revolutions in 1 minute 30 seconds. Which of the two wheels spins faster?", "completion": "To determine which wheel spins faster, we need to compare their revolutions per minute (rpm).\n\nWheel A makes 10 revolutions in 2 minutes. To find the revolutions per minute, we divide the number of revolutions by the number of minutes:\n10 revolutions / 2 minutes = 5 revolutions per minute (rpm)\n\nWheel B makes 7 revolutions in 1 minute 30 seconds. First, we need to convert 1 minute 30 seconds to minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 30 seconds is equal to 0.5 minutes. So, 1 minute 30 seconds is equal to 1.5 minutes. Now we can calculate the revolutions per minute for Wheel B:\n7 revolutions / 1.5 minutes = 4.67 revolutions per minute (rpm) (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nComparing the two:\nWheel A: 5 rpm\nWheel B: 4.67 rpm\n\nWheel A spins faster because it has a higher rpm."}

In other words, \\( n \\) is 3 more than a multiple of 5.\n\nSimilarly, when the students form 7 lines, there are 2 left over.

{"prompt": "Given two natural numbers A and B, if B is A multiplied by 9 and plus 13, what is the remainder when B is divided by 9?", "completion": "Let's denote A as a natural number. According to the given information, B can be expressed as:\n\nB = A * 9 + 13\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when B is divided by 9. To do this, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. When dividing a number by 9, the remainder is the same as the remainder of the sum of its digits divided by 9. However, in this case, we can simply look at the expression for B.\n\nSince A * 9 is a multiple of 9, it will not contribute to the remainder when B is divided by 9. The remainder will solely depend on the \"+ 13\" part of the expression.\n\nWhen 13 is divided by 9, the quotient is 1 and the remainder is 4.

We have 3 choices for the first digit because we can't use 0. So, we can use 4, 5, or 7.\n\nNext, for the second digit (tens place), we have 3 choices again because after choosing the first digit, we are left with 3 cards, and now we can also use the 0.\n\nFinally, for the third digit (ones place), we have 2 choices remaining because we've already used two cards for the first two digits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit integers we can form is the product of the number of choices for each digit:\n\n3 (choices for the first digit) * 3 (choices for the second digit) * 2 (choices for the third digit) = 3 * 3 * 2 = 18\n\nSo, we can make 18 different three-digit integers by drawing 3 out of the 4 cards with the numbers 0, 4, 5, and 7 written on them."}

{"prompt": "A three-digit number with 3 in the hundreds is divisible when divided by 4. How many three-digit numbers that meet this condition are there? ", "completion": "To find the three-digit numbers with 3 in the hundreds place that are divisible by 4, we need to consider the numbers in the range from 300 to 399.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the last two digits of the number must form a number that is divisible by 4. So, we need to find all the two-digit numbers from 00 to 99 that are divisible by 4 and then append them to the digit 3 to form the three-digit numbers we are looking for.\n\nLet's start by finding the two-digit numbers divisible by 4 within the range 00 to 99:\n\n- The smallest two-digit number divisible by 4 is 00 (which we can consider as 0 for this purpose).\n- The next one is 04, then 08, 12, 16, and so on, increasing by 4 each time.\n\nTo find the largest two-digit number divisible by 4 that is less than 100, we can divide 100 by 4 and take the integer part of the result:\n\n100 \u00f7 4 = 25 (remainder 0)\n\nSo, the largest multiple of 4 that is a two-digit number is 25 * 4 = 100 (but since we are looking for two-digit numbers, we consider 96 as the largest).\n\nNow, we can find the total count of such numbers by taking the difference between the largest and smallest multiples of 4 within the range and dividing by 4, then adding 1 (since we are including 00 as a valid two-digit number):\n\n(96 - 0) \u00f7 4 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25\n\nSo, there are 25 two-digit numbers divisible by 4 between 00 and 99. Each of these can be appended to the digit 3 to form a three-digit number, so there are also 25 three-digit numbers with 3 in the hundreds place that are divisible by 4."}

To find the weight of 1 meter, we divide the total weight by the total length:\n\nWeight per meter of tape measure = (29/8) kg / 5 m = (29/8) * (1/5) kg/m = 29/40 kg/m\n\nNow, we want to find the weight of 2 meters of the tape measure:\n\nWeight of 2 meters of tape measure = 2 m * (29/40) kg/m = 58/40 kg = 29/20 kg\n\nThe computer is 4 meters long and weighs 2.8 kg.

How many students went to church?", "completion": "Let's denote the number of chairs in the church as C and the number of students as S.\n\nFrom the first condition, if 9 students sit per chair, one student cannot sit. This means that the total number of students is one more than a multiple of 9. So we can write this as:\nS = 9C + 1  (1)\n\nFrom the second condition, if 10 students sit per chair, 1 chair becomes vacant. This means that the total number of students is 10 less than a multiple of 10 times the number of chairs. So we can write this as:\nS = 10C - 10  (2)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for S by equating the two expressions for S:\n\n9C + 1 = 10C - 10\n\nSubtract 9C from both sides to get:\n1 = C - 10\n\nAdd 10 to both sides to find the number of chairs:\nC = 11\n\nNow that we know there are 11 chairs, we can substitute this value back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the number of students. Let's use equation (1):\n\nS = 9C + 1\nS = 9(11) + 1\nS = 99 + 1\nS = 100\n\nSo, there are 100 students who went to church."}

We need to find the sum of the correctly calculated quotient and remainder when the divisor is 65.\n\nLet's first find the value of Y. Since X is 65, reversing its digits gives us Y = 56.\n\nNow we can use the equation we have with Y to find the value of D:\n\nD = 56 * 25 + 25\nD = 1400 + 25\nD = 1425\n\nNow we have the value of the dividend D.

{"prompt": "There are two natural numbers A and B. If B is A multiplied by 9 and plus 13, what is the remainder when B is divided by 9?", "completion": "Let's denote A as a natural number. According to the given information, B can be expressed as:\n\nB = A * 9 + 13\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when B is divided by 9. To do this, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. When dividing a number by 9, the remainder is the same as the remainder of the sum of its digits divided by 9. However, in this case, we can simplify the process by looking at the expression for B.\n\nSince A is multiplied by 9, any natural number multiplied by 9 will give a multiple of 9, which means it will have a remainder of 0 when divided by 9. So, the first part of the expression (A * 9) will not contribute to the remainder when B is divided by 9.\n\nThe second part of the expression is the constant 13. When we divide 13 by 9, we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 4. Therefore, the remainder of B when divided by 9 is the same as the remainder of 13 when divided by 9, which is 4.\n\nSo, the remainder when B is divided by 9 is 4."}

{"prompt": "For the three natural numbers A, B, and C, find the number of ordered pairs that satisfy A + B + C = 8.", "completion": "To find the number of ordered pairs (A, B, C) that satisfy the equation A + B + C = 8, we can use a combinatorial approach. Since A, B, and C are natural numbers, they must be positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nWe can use the \"stars and bars\" method, which is a common technique in combinatorics for solving problems of this type. However, since we are dealing with natural numbers, we need to ensure that each of A, B, and C is at least 1. To do this, we can first give each of A, B, and C one unit to ensure they are natural numbers. This means we have already used 3 units, so we have 8 - 3 = 5 units left to distribute among A, B, and C.\n\nNow, we can think of the problem as finding the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable units (stars) among 3 distinguishable bins (A, B, and C) with no restrictions. We can represent the units as stars (*) and the separations between bins as bars (|). For example, an arrangement like \"*|**|**\" would correspond to A=1, B=2, C=2.\n\nThe total number of positions in our stars-and-bars representation is 5 (stars) + 2 (bars) = 7. We need to choose 2 positions out of these 7 to place the bars. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \"7 choose 2\", which is calculated as:\n\n7 choose 2 = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!)\n           = 7! / (2! * 5!)\n           = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n           = 42 / 2\n           = 21\n\nSo, there are 21 ordered pairs (A, B, C) of natural numbers that satisfy the equation A + B + C = 8."}

{"prompt": "Find the number of vertices of a solid figure whose bases are parallel and congruent polygons and whose sides are six rectangles.", "completion": "The solid figure described is a prism with two parallel and congruent polygonal bases and six rectangular sides. Since the sides are rectangles, we know that each rectangle has four vertices. However, we cannot simply multiply the number of rectangles by four to find the total number of vertices because the vertices are shared between the rectangles and the polygonal bases.\n\nTo find the number of vertices, we need to determine the number of vertices in one of the polygonal bases. Since the bases are congruent, they will have the same number of vertices. The number of rectangles (six) tells us that the polygonal bases must each have six sides (because each rectangle corresponds to one side of the polygonal base). Therefore, each polygonal base is a hexagon.\n\nA hexagon has six vertices. Since there are two hexagonal bases, we have a total of 6 (vertices in one base) x 2 (bases) = 12 vertices.\n\nSo, the solid figure has 12 vertices in total."}

Starting with C, there are another 3! permutations of ABD.\n4. Starting with D, there are another 3! permutations of ABC.\n\nSince CABD starts with C, we can ignore all permutations that start with A and B.

{"prompt": "You made a round loop by gluing twelve sheets of paper tape that are each 18 centimeters (cm) long. If they are overlapped by the same length and the shape has a perimeter of 210 centimeters (cm), how many millimeters (mm) are the overlapped parts?", "completion": "First, let's find the total length of the paper tape before overlapping. Since each sheet is 18 cm long and there are 12 sheets, the total length would be:\n\nTotal length = 12 sheets * 18 cm/sheet = 216 cm\n\nNow, we know that the perimeter of the loop after overlapping is 210 cm. This means that the overlapping has reduced the total length by:\n\nReduction in length = Total length - Perimeter after overlapping\nReduction in length = 216 cm - 210 cm = 6 cm\n\nSince the sheets are overlapped by the same length, we need to find out the length of each overlap. There are 12 sheets, so there are 12 overlaps. Therefore, the length of each overlap would be:\n\nLength of each overlap = Reduction in length / Number of overlaps\nLength of each overlap = 6 cm / 12 = 0.5 cm\n\nTo convert this length into millimeters (mm), we use the conversion factor that 1 cm is equal to 10 mm. So:\n\nLength of each overlap in mm = Length of each overlap in cm * 10 mm/cm\nLength of each overlap in mm = 0.5 cm * 10 mm/cm = 5 mm\n\nTherefore, the overlapped parts are 5 mm each."}

Since all sides of a cube are equal, the volume of the cube is:\n\nVolume of cube = side^3\nVolume of cube = 1m * 1m * 1m\nVolume of cube = 1m^3\n\nSince 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, we can convert the volume of the cube to cubic centimeters (cm^3) for easier comparison with the cuboid:\n\nVolume of cube = 1m^3\nVolume of cube = (100cm * 100cm * 100cm)\nVolume of cube = 1,000,000cm^3\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume of the cuboid:\n\nVolume of cuboid = width * length * height\nVolume of cuboid = 50cm * 50cm * 20cm\nVolume of cuboid = 50,000cm^3\n\nTo find out how many times the volume of the cube is the volume of the cuboid, we divide the volume of the cube by the volume of the cuboid:\n\nNumber of times = Volume of cube / Volume of cuboid\nNumber of times = 1,000,000cm^3 / 50,000cm^3\nNumber of times = 20\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cube is 20 times the volume of the cuboid."}
{"prompt": "Red paint was applied to all faces of a cuboid measuring 5 centimeters (cm) wide, 4 centimeters (cm) long, and 3 centimeters (cm) high. Then, this cuboid was cut into 60 cubes with each edge being 1 centimeters (cm) long. What is the number of cube pieces that are colored on only one side?", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the original cuboid and how it was cut into smaller cubes. Since the original cuboid was painted on all faces before being cut, only the cubes on the outer layer will have any paint on them. The cubes in the interior will not have any paint.\n\nThe original cuboid has dimensions of 5 cm by 4 cm by 3 cm, and it was cut into 1 cm cubes. This means that along the width, there are 5 cubes; along the length, there are 4 cubes; and along the height, there are 3 cubes.\n\nThe cubes that are painted on only one side will be the ones that are not on an edge or a corner but are on one of the faces. We can calculate the number of such cubes for each face and then sum them up.\n\nFor the top and bottom faces (each 5 cm by 4 cm), the cubes on the edges will not be counted, only the ones in the interior. So, for each of these faces, we have (5 - 2) * (4 - 2) = 3 * 2 = 6 cubes painted on one side. Since there are two such faces (top and bottom), we have 6 * 2 = 12 cubes.\n\nFor the front and back faces (each 5 cm by 3 cm), we again avoid the edges. So, for each of these faces, we have (5 - 2) * (3 - 2) = 3 * 1 = 3 cubes painted on one side. Since there are two such faces (front and back), we have 3 * 2 = 6 cubes.\n\nFor the left and right faces (each 4 cm by 3 cm), we again avoid the edges. So, for each of these faces, we have (4 - 2) * (3 - 2) = 2 * 1 = 2 cubes painted on one side. Since there are two such faces (left and right), we have 2 * 2 = 4 cubes.\n\nAdding these up, we get the total number of cubes painted on only one side:\n12 (top and bottom) + 6 (front and back) + 4 (left and right) = 22 cubes.\n\nTherefore, there are 22 cube pieces that are colored on only one side."}

{"prompt": "Which is the smallest among circle A with a diameter of 10 centimeters (cm), circle B with a radius of 4 centimeters (cm), and circle C with a sum of 9 in its diameter and radius?", "completion": "To determine the smallest circle, we need to compare their sizes, which can be done by looking at their radii.\n\nCircle A has a diameter of 10 cm, so its radius is half of that, which is 5 cm.\n\nCircle B has a radius of 4 cm.\n\nCircle C has a sum of 9 cm for its diameter and radius. Let's denote the diameter as D and the radius as R. We know that the radius is half the diameter, so R = D/2. The sum of the diameter and radius is given as D + R = 9 cm. Substituting R = D/2 into the equation, we get D + D/2 = 9 cm. Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction, we get 2D + D = 18 cm, which simplifies to 3D = 18 cm. Dividing both sides by 3, we find D = 6 cm. Therefore, the radius R of circle C is half of that, which is 3 cm.\n\nNow we can compare the radii:\n\n- Circle A radius = 5 cm\n- Circle B radius = 4 cm\n- Circle C radius = 3 cm\n\nCircle C, with a radius of 3 cm, is the smallest among the three circles."}

{"prompt": "Woojin's family harvested potatoes in the field. The younger brother dug out 3.8 kilograms (kg), and the older sister dug out 8.4 kilograms (kg) more than the younger brother did. If Woojin dug out 3720 grams (g) more than 1/10 of the weight of her sister did, how many kilograms (kg) of Woojin's harvested potatoes?", "completion": "First, let's find out how much the older sister dug out. She dug out 8.4 kg more than the younger brother, who dug out 3.8 kg. So, the older sister dug out:\n\n3.8 kg + 8.4 kg = 12.2 kg\n\nNow, let's find out 1/10 of the weight the older sister dug out:\n\n1/10 * 12.2 kg = 1.22 kg\n\nWoojin dug out 3720 grams (g) more than 1/10 of the weight of her sister did. Since 1 kg is equal to 1000 g, we need to convert 1.22 kg to grams:\n\n1.22 kg * 1000 g/kg = 1220 g\n\nNow, let's add the 3720 g that Woojin dug out more than 1/10 of her sister's weight:\n\n1220 g + 3720 g = 4940 g\n\nFinally, we need to convert Woojin's weight from grams to kilograms:\n\n4940 g / 1000 g/kg = 4.94 kg\n\nSo, Woojin harvested 4.94 kilograms (kg) of potatoes."}

{"prompt": "With 10,000 won, Seonwoo bought 2 packets of bubblegum at 600 won each and 9 bags of ramen that costs 1600 won for 2 bags. How much change did Seonwoo receive?", "completion": "First, let's calculate the total cost of the bubblegum. Since each packet costs 600 won and Seonwoo bought 2 packets, the total cost for the bubblegum is:\n\n2 packets * 600 won/packet = 1200 won\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the ramen. Since 2 bags cost 1600 won and Seonwoo bought 9 bags, we need to find out how many times 2 goes into 9 to determine how many times Seonwoo pays 1600 won. \n\n9 bags / 2 bags = 4.5\n\nSince Seonwoo can't buy half a set, we'll round down to 4 sets of 2 bags, which means Seonwoo buys 8 bags for the price of 4 sets of 1600 won, and 1 bag will be left out of this calculation. \n\n4 sets * 1600 won/set = 6400 won\n\nNow, we need to add the cost of the extra bag of ramen. Since 2 bags cost 1600 won, 1 bag would cost half of that:\n\n1600 won / 2 = 800 won\n\nAdding this to the cost of the 8 bags:\n\n6400 won + 800 won = 7200 won\n\nNow, let's add the total cost of the bubblegum and the ramen to find the total cost of Seonwoo's purchase:\n\n1200 won (bubblegum) + 7200 won (ramen) = 8400 won\n\nFinally, let's calculate the change Seonwoo received. Seonwoo started with 10,000 won and spent 8400 won:\n\n10,000 won - 8400 won = 1600 won\n\nSeonwoo received 1600 won in change."}

Similarly, \"B2\" means the tens digit is B and the ones digit is 2.\n\nThe subtraction equation can be rewritten as:\n\n(80 + A) - (10B + 2) = 45\n\nNow, let's solve for A and B:\n\n80 + A - 10B - 2 = 45\n80 + A - 10B = 45 + 2\n80 + A - 10B = 47\n\nNow, we need to find values of A and B such that the equation holds true. Since A and B are single-digit numbers, we can try different combinations to see which one works.\n\nLet's start by finding a value for B that makes the left side of the equation close to 47 when subtracted from 80. We can start with B = 3 (since B2 must be a two-digit number and B cannot be 0):\n\n80 + A - 10(3) = 47\n80 + A - 30 = 47\nA = 47 - 80 + 30\nA = 77 - 80\nA = -3\n\nSince A cannot be negative, B = 3 is not the correct value.

{"prompt": "There are 5 fish A, B, C, D, and E. A is faster than B and slower than C. E is slower than D. B is faster than D. Which fish is the slowest?", "completion": "From the information given, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. A is faster than B but slower than C, so the order so far is C > A > B.\n2. E is slower than D, so E < D.\n3. B is faster than D, so B > D.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the information about D and E with the order we have for A, B, and C. Since B is faster than D, and we already know A is faster than B, both A and B are faster than D. This means the order is now C > A > B > D.\n\nSince E is slower than D, E is the slowest of all. So the final order from fastest to slowest is C > A > B > D > E.\n\nTherefore, E is the slowest fish."}

{"prompt": "There are 24 female and male students in total. Among them, 50 sheets of colored paper were equally distributed to female students only, and 2 sheets were left. How many pieces of colored paper will the girls have if there are twice as many boys as girls?", "completion": "Let's denote the number of female students as F and the number of male students as M. According to the information given, there are twice as many boys as girls, so we can write:\n\nM = 2F\n\nWe also know that the total number of students is 24:\n\nF + M = 24\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get:\n\nF + 2F = 24\n3F = 24\nF = 24 / 3\nF = 8\n\nSo there are 8 female students.\n\nNow, we know that 50 sheets of colored paper were distributed equally among the female students, with 2 sheets left over. This means that the number of sheets each female student received is an integer, and the total number of sheets distributed to the female students is 50 - 2 = 48 sheets.\n\nSince there are 8 female students, we can divide the 48 sheets equally among them:\n\n48 sheets / 8 students = 6 sheets per student\n\nTherefore, each female student will have 6 pieces of colored paper."}

{"prompt": "The faucet is filling the water tank at the speed of 36.6 liters (l) per minute, but there is a hole in the bottom of the tank, so that water leaks out of the tank at the speed of 2.4 liters (l) per minute. If the water tank contained 10 liters (l) of water initially, how many liters (l) of water is in the water tank after 7 minutes 45 seconds?", "completion": "First, let's convert the time from minutes and seconds to just minutes to make the calculation easier. We have 7 minutes and 45 seconds, which is 7 minutes plus 45 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 45 seconds is equal to 45/60 minutes.\n\n45/60 = 0.75 minutes\n\nSo, the total time in minutes is 7 + 0.75 = 7.75 minutes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net rate at which the water is filling the tank. The faucet fills the tank at 36.6 liters per minute, and the hole leaks water at 2.4 liters per minute. So the net rate of water filling the tank is:\n\n36.6 liters/minute (filling) - 2.4 liters/minute (leaking) = 34.2 liters/minute (net filling rate)\n\nNow we can calculate the amount of water that is added to the tank in 7.75 minutes at the net filling rate:\n\n34.2 liters/minute * 7.75 minutes = 265.05 liters\n\nHowever, we must remember that the tank already contained 10 liters of water initially. So, the total amount of water in the tank after 7.75 minutes is:\n\nInitial water + Added water = 10 liters + 265.05 liters = 275.05 liters\n\nTherefore, after 7 minutes and 45 seconds, there are 275.05 liters of water in the water tank."}

Since the sequence starts with 4, the 5th multiple will be \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\nNext, let's find the 8th multiple of 4 from the right. Since the sequence ends with 96 (the largest multiple of 4 less than 100), we need to count backwards 8 multiples of 4 from 96. \n\nTo find the 8th multiple from the right, we can subtract \\(4 \\times 7\\) from 96 (because we already have the last multiple, 96, so we subtract 7 more steps to get the 8th from the right):\n\n\\(96 - (4 \\times 7) = 96 - 28 = 68\\)\n\nSo the 8th multiple from the right is 68.\n\nNow we need to count how many multiples of 4 are between 20 and 68.

{"prompt": "You are going to use all of the 30 centimeters (cm) of wire to make one rectangular shape. If the short side of the rectangle is 7 centimeters (cm), how many centimeters (cm) should the long side be?", "completion": "To find the length of the long side of the rectangle, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangle using the total length of the wire. Since the perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle, and we know the total length of the wire is 30 cm, the perimeter of the rectangle is also 30 cm.\n\nA rectangle has two short sides and two long sides. If one short side is 7 cm, then the other short side is also 7 cm.

Since 10^3 \u2261 1 (mod 357), we can reduce the powers of 10 by taking them modulo 357:\n\n10^1 \u2261 10 (mod 357)\n10^2 \u2261 100 (mod 357)\n10^3 \u2261 1 (mod 357)\n10^4 \u2261 10 (mod 357)\n10^5 \u2261 100 (mod 357)\n10^6 \u2261 1 (mod 357)\n10^7 \u2261 10 (mod 357)\n\nUsing these congruences, we can simplify the original equation:\n\n(7 * 10 + 5 * 1 + 7 * 100 + A * 10 + B * 1 + 3 * 100 + 8 * 10 + 4 * 1) \u2261 0 (mod 357)\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the known digits:\n\n7 * 10 + 5 * 1 + 7 * 100 + 3 * 100 + 8 * 10 + 4 * 1 = 70 + 5 + 700 + 300 + 80 + 4 = 1159\n\nNow, we can simplify 1159 modulo 357:\n\n1159 \u2261 88 (mod 357)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n(88 + A * 10 + B) \u2261 0 (mod 357)\n\nSince we are only looking for the value of A, we can ignore B for now and focus on finding a value for A such that (88 + A * 10) is divisible by 357.\n\nLet's try to find a value for A that satisfies the equation:\n\n88 + A * 10 \u2261 0 (mod 357)\n\nWe can try values for A from 0 to 9 and check which one makes the expression divisible by 357. Let's start with A = 0 and increase A by 1 until we find a value that works:\n\nFor A = 0: 88 + 0 * 10 = 88 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 1: 88 + 1 * 10 = 98 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 2: 88 + 2 * 10 = 108 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 3: 88 + 3 * 10 = 118 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 4: 88 + 4 * 10 = 128 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 5: 88 + 5 * 10 = 138 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 6: 88 + 6 * 10 = 148 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 7: 88 + 7 * 10 = 158 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 8: 88 + 8 * 10 = 168 (not divisible by 357)\nFor A = 9: 88 + 9 * 10 = 178 (not divisible by 357)\n\nNone of the values for A from 0 to 9 make the expression divisible by 357. This suggests that we may have made a mistake in our calculations or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate our approach.\n\nWe need to find a value for A such that the entire number 757AB384 is divisible by 357. Since we are given that the number is divisible by 357, we can use this information to find A.\n\nLet's divide the number without the digit A by 357 and see the remainder:\n\n757?B384 / 357\n\nWe can use long division or a calculator to find the remainder when 75700384 (assuming A=0) is divided by 357. Then we can adjust the value of A to make the entire number divisible by 357.\n\nLet's calculate the remainder:\n\n75700384 mod 357 = 301\n\nNow, we need to find a value for A such that when we add A * 10^4 to 75700384, the result is divisible by 357. We can do this by finding how much we need to add to 301 to get to the next multiple of 357.\n\nThe next multiple of 357 after 301 is 357 itself, so we need to add 56 to 301 to get to 357.\n\nNow, we need to find a value for A such that A * 10^4 mod 357 = 56.\n\nSince 10^4 mod 357 = 10, we have:\n\nA * 10 \u2261 56 (mod 357)\n\nTo find A, we can divide 56 by 10:\n\n56 / 10 = 5.6\n\nSince A must be an integer, we take the integer part of 5.6, which is 5.\n\nTherefore, A = 5.\n\nLet's verify by checking if 7575B384 is divisible by 357:\n\n7575B384 mod 357 = 0 (for some value of B)\n\nSince we are only asked to find A, we have determined that A = 5."}

{"prompt": "From the 0.35 kilometer (km) point to the 0.37 kilometer (km) point of a certain road, it was decided to divide it into 4 equal sections and plant street trees from beginning to end. How many kilometers (km) is the location of the street tree planted at the fourth point using a decimal number?", "completion": "To find the location of the street tree planted at the fourth point, we first need to determine the length of each section. The total length of the road from the 0.35 km point to the 0.37 km point is:\n\n0.37 km - 0.35 km = 0.02 km\n\nSince this length is to be divided into 4 equal sections, each section will be:\n\n0.02 km / 4 = 0.005 km\n\nThe fourth point would be at the end of the fourth section. To find its location, we add the length of four sections to the starting point:\n\n0.35 km + (4 * 0.005 km) = 0.35 km + 0.02 km = 0.37 km\n\nTherefore, the location of the street tree planted at the fourth point is at the 0.37 kilometer mark."}
{"prompt": "When there is a basket containing each apple, peach, pear, melon, and strawberry, two fruits are taken out. What is the possible number of cases if those combinations are numbered according to the order it comes out?", "completion": "When two fruits are taken out of the basket, the order in which they are taken out matters because the combinations are numbered according to the order they come out. This means that taking out an apple first and a peach second is considered a different case than taking out a peach first and an apple second.\n\nSince there are 5 different fruits, the first fruit can be any one of the 5. After the first fruit is taken out, there are 4 fruits left, so the second fruit can be any one of the remaining 4.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible cases for taking out two fruits is the product of the number of choices for the first fruit and the number of choices for the second fruit:\n\nNumber of cases = 5 (choices for the first fruit) \u00d7 4 (choices for the second fruit) = 20 possible cases."}
{"prompt": "What is the average of the natural numbers from 12 to 53?", "completion": "To find the average of the natural numbers from 12 to 53, we first need to find the sum of these numbers and then divide by the count of numbers.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:\nSum = n/2 * (first number + last number)\nwhere n is the number of terms.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of terms (n). Since our series is 12, 13, 14, ..., 53, we can calculate n as follows:\nn = (last number - first number) / common difference + 1\nn = (53 - 12) / 1 + 1\nn = 41 + 1\nn = 42\n\nNow we can find the sum of these numbers:\nSum = n/2 * (first number + last number)\nSum = 42/2 * (12 + 53)\nSum = 21 * 65\nSum = 1365\n\nFinally, we find the average by dividing the sum by the number of terms:\nAverage = Sum / n\nAverage = 1365 / 42\nAverage = 32.5\n\nSo, the average of the natural numbers from 12 to 53 is 32.5."}

{"prompt": "There are 24 students. Among them, 50 sheets of colored paper were equally distributed to female students only, and 2 sheets were left. If the number of boys is twice the number of girls, how many pieces of colored paper will each girl receive?", "completion": "Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of boys is twice the number of girls, so we can write:\nB = 2G\n\nWe also know that there are 24 students in total, so we can write:\nG + B = 24\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get:\nG + 2G = 24\n3G = 24\nG = 24 / 3\nG = 8\n\nSo there are 8 girls.\n\nNow, we know that 50 sheets of colored paper were distributed among the girls, with 2 sheets left over. This means that the number of sheets that were actually distributed is 50 - 2 = 48 sheets.\n\nSince these 48 sheets were equally distributed among the 8 girls, each girl would receive:\n48 sheets / 8 girls = 6 sheets\n\nTherefore, each girl will receive 6 pieces of colored paper."}

However, we must consider that the 4 points on the same line can only form one unique straight line when joined in any combination. Therefore, we have counted extra lines for the combinations of these 4 collinear points.\n\nSince any two points on the same line form the same line, we have to subtract the extra lines we counted for the 4 collinear points. We have counted \\( C(4, 2) \\) lines for the 4 collinear points, but there is actually only 1 unique line.\n\n\\[ C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \\]\n\\[ C(4, 2) = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 2!} \\]\n\\[ C(4, 2) = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} \\]\n\\[ C(4, 2) = \\frac{12}{2} \\]\n\\[ C(4, 2) = 6 \\]\n\nSo, we have counted 6 lines for the 4 collinear points, but there is only 1 unique line. Therefore, we need to subtract the extra 5 lines we counted.\n\n\\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \\]\n\nThus, there are 5 different straight lines that can be made by joining any two of these 5 points, considering that 4 of them are collinear."}

According to the information given, there were 17 men fewer than women at the first stop, so we can write:\n\nM = W - 17\n\nAt the next station, 57 women and 18 men got on, and 44 people got off. So the total number of people who got on the subway at the next station is 57 + 18 = 75. The net increase in the number of people on the subway at the next station is 75 - 44 = 31.\n\nNow, we know that there are 502 people on the subway right now. This total includes the people who got on at the first stop (W + M) and the net increase at the next station (31). So we can write:\n\nW + M + 31 = 502\n\nSubstituting the first equation (M = W - 17) into the second equation, we get:\n\nW + (W - 17) + 31 = 502\n2W - 17 + 31 = 502\n2W + 14 = 502\n2W = 502 - 14\n2W = 488\nW = 488 / 2\nW = 244\n\nNow that we know the number of women who got on at the first stop (W = 244), we can find the number of men (M):\n\nM = W - 17\nM = 244 - 17\nM = 227\n\nSo, 227 men got on the subway at the first stop."}

According to the problem, when x is multiplied by 7/12, the result is 42. We can write this as an equation:\n\n(7/12) * x = 42\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 7/12:\n\nx = 42 / (7/12)\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 7/12 is 12/7. So we have:\n\nx = 42 * (12/7)\n\nNow, we can simplify this by canceling out the common factors:\n\nx = 6 * 12\nx = 72\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find out what happens when x is multiplied by 11/18 and then 4 is subtracted:\n\n(11/18) * x - 4 = (11/18) * 72 - 4\n\nFirst, we multiply 72 by 11/18:\n\n(11/18) * 72 = 11 * 4\n               = 44\n\nNow, we subtract 4 from the result:\n\n44 - 4 = 40\n\nSo, when the certain number (which is 72) is multiplied by 11/18 and then 4 is subtracted, the value is 40."}

If 8 of these rabbits are female, then the number of male rabbits would be the total number of rabbits minus the number of female rabbits. \n\nSo, the number of male rabbits is 21 - 8 = 13 male rabbits."}
{"prompt": "There are 275 apples. I am going to put 20 apples in a box and sell them for 8,000 won each. If you sold all the boxes of apples, how much did you get after selling the apples?", "completion": "First, we need to determine how many boxes of apples you can make with 275 apples. Since each box contains 20 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per box:\n\n275 apples \u00f7 20 apples/box = 13.75 boxes\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a box, you can only sell whole boxes. So you can sell 13 full boxes of apples.\n\nNow, to find out how much money you made from selling the apples, we multiply the number of boxes sold by the price per box:\n\n13 boxes \u00d7 8,000 won/box = 104,000 won\n\nSo, after selling all the boxes of apples, you made 104,000 won."}

Choose the first digit: There are 5 options for the first digit (4, 5, 6, 7, or 8).\n2. Choose the second digit: After choosing the first digit, there are 4 remaining options for the second digit, since it must be different from the first.\n\nTherefore, the total number of two-digit numbers that can be formed is the product of the number of options for the first digit and the number of options for the second digit:\n\n5 (options for the first digit) \u00d7 4 (options for the second digit) = 20 two-digit numbers."}
{"prompt": "I made an ade with 3, 2/6 spoons of blueberry syrup, and 21/6 spoons of grapefruit syrup. Find out which syrup is contained more in the ade, the blueberry syrup or the grapefruit syrup?", "completion": "To compare the amounts of blueberry syrup and grapefruit syrup in the ade, we need to convert the fractions to a common denominator or convert them to improper fractions to make them easier to compare.\n\nFor the blueberry syrup, you have 3 whole spoons and 2/6 of a spoon. To convert this to an improper fraction, you multiply the whole number by the denominator and add the numerator:\n\n3 (whole spoons) * 6 (denominator) + 2 (numerator) = 18 + 2 = 20/6 spoons of blueberry syrup.\n\nFor the grapefruit syrup, you have 21/6 spoons, which is already an improper fraction.\n\nNow, let's compare the two:\n\nBlueberry syrup: 20/6 spoons\nGrapefruit syrup: 21/6 spoons\n\nSince 21/6 is greater than 20/6, the ade contains more grapefruit syrup than blueberry syrup."}

{"prompt": "There is a frame in the shape of a square with a side length of 20 centimeters (cm). What is the area of the largest medallion that can be stored in a circular medallion? However, the ratio of circumference is assumed to be 3.14.", "completion": "To find the area of the largest circular medallion that can be stored in a square frame, we need to determine the diameter of the circle that can fit within the square. Since the square has a side length of 20 cm, the diameter of the largest circle that can fit within the square will also be 20 cm, as the diameter of the circle will be equal to the side length of the square.\n\nThe radius (r) of the circle is half of the diameter, so in this case, the radius will be:\n\nr = diameter / 2\nr = 20 cm / 2\nr = 10 cm\n\nThe area (A) of a circle is calculated using the formula:\n\nA = \u03c0 * r^2\n\nGiven that the ratio of the circumference (\u03c0) is assumed to be 3.14, we can use this value to calculate the area:\n\nA = 3.14 * (10 cm)^2\nA = 3.14 * 100 cm^2\nA = 314 cm^2\n\nTherefore, the area of the largest circular medallion that can be stored in the square frame is 314 square centimeters."}

{"prompt": "Yoongi's math score is 82, and his Korean score is 5 points higher than his math score. How many points does he need to get in English to get an average score of 89 in Korean, Mathematics, and English?", "completion": "First, let's find out Yoongi's Korean score. Since it's 5 points higher than his math score, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nKorean score = Math score + 5 points\nKorean score = 82 + 5\nKorean score = 87\n\nNow, we know that Yoongi wants an average score of 89 across Korean, Mathematics, and English. To find the total points he needs to achieve this average, we multiply the desired average by the number of subjects:\n\nTotal points needed = Average score \u00d7 Number of subjects\nTotal points needed = 89 \u00d7 3\nTotal points needed = 267\n\nWe already know Yoongi's scores in Math and Korean, so we can add those up:\n\nTotal points from Math and Korean = Math score + Korean score\nTotal points from Math and Korean = 82 + 87\nTotal points from Math and Korean = 169\n\nNow, we subtract the total points Yoongi has from Math and Korean from the total points needed to find out how many points he needs in English:\n\nPoints needed in English = Total points needed - Total points from Math and Korean\nPoints needed in English = 267 - 169\nPoints needed in English = 98\n\nTherefore, Yoongi needs to score 98 points in English to achieve an average score of 89 across the three subjects."}
{"prompt": "A cloud train with a length of 20 meters (m) is running at 288 centimeters (cm) per second. If this train took 25 seconds to completely pass the tunnel, find the length of the tunnel in meters (m).", "completion": "First, we need to convert the speed of the cloud train from centimeters per second to meters per second. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, we divide the speed in centimeters per second by 100 to get the speed in meters per second.\n\nSpeed in meters per second = 288 cm/s \u00f7 100 = 2.88 m/s\n\nNow, we know the train took 25 seconds to completely pass through the tunnel. To find the distance the train traveled in that time, we multiply the speed by the time:\n\nDistance traveled = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance traveled = 2.88 m/s \u00d7 25 s = 72 meters\n\nThis distance includes the length of the train itself plus the length of the tunnel. Since the train is 20 meters long, we subtract the length of the train from the total distance to find the length of the tunnel:\n\nLength of the tunnel = Distance traveled - Length of the train\nLength of the tunnel = 72 m - 20 m = 52 meters\n\nTherefore, the length of the tunnel is 52 meters."}
{"prompt": "There is 1 liter (L) of water. The mother drank 0.1 liters (L), and the father drank 0.2 liters (L) more than the mother. If your sister drank 0.3 liters (L) at this time, how many liters (L) of water is left?", "completion": "Let's calculate the total amount of water consumed by the family.\n\nThe mother drank: 0.1 L\nThe father drank 0.2 L more than the mother, so he drank: 0.1 L + 0.2 L = 0.3 L\nThe sister drank: 0.3 L\n\nNow, let's add up the total amount of water they drank:\nTotal water consumed = Mother's consumption + Father's consumption + Sister's consumption\nTotal water consumed = 0.1 L + 0.3 L + 0.3 L\nTotal water consumed = 0.7 L\n\nNow, let's subtract the total water consumed from the initial amount of water to find out how much is left:\nWater left = Initial amount - Total water consumed\nWater left = 1 L - 0.7 L\nWater left = 0.3 L\n\nSo, there are 0.3 liters of water left."}
{"prompt": "There are 5 different points on the circle. How many straight lines can be formed by connecting two of these points? Note that the line created with one point and the first next point that meet while following a circle does not count.", "completion": "To form a straight line, you need to connect two distinct points. Since there are 5 points on the circle, you can choose the first point in 5 ways and the second point in 4 ways. However, this counts each line twice (once for each direction: A to B and B to A), so you need to divide by 2 to get the correct number of distinct lines.\n\nSo the number of straight lines that can be formed is (5 * 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nHowever, you've specified that the line created by connecting a point to the immediate next point while following the circle does not count. Since there are 5 points, there would be 5 such lines that we need to exclude (each point connected to its immediate neighbor).\n\nTherefore, the total number of straight lines that can be formed, excluding the immediate next point connections, is 10 - 5 = 5 lines."}
{"prompt": "Minyoung's average score for Korean and English is 89 points.

So the total volume of the small cubes dug out is:\n\n\\[ V_{dug out} = 5 \\times V_{small} = 5 \\times 1 = 5 \\text{ cm}^3 \\]\n\nFinally, to find the volume of the resulting shape after digging out the small cubes, we subtract the volume of the dug-out cubes from the volume of the original cube:\n\n\\[ V_{resulting} = V_{original} - V_{dug out} = 125 \\text{ cm}^3 - 5 \\text{ cm}^3 = 120 \\text{ cm}^3 \\]\n\nSo the volume of the resulting shape is 120 cubic centimeters (cm^3)."}
{"prompt": "There are 16 of Hoseok and his friends. How many friends are to Hoseok's left when there are 8 friends to Hoseok's right?", "completion": "If there are 8 friends to Hoseok's right, then Hoseok is the 9th person from the right (since we count Hoseok as well). Since there are 16 people in total, we can subtract the 9 people on the right (including Hoseok) from the total to find out how many are to his left.\n\n16 (total people) - 9 (Hoseok + friends to his right) = 7 friends to Hoseok's left."}
{"prompt": "You planted sunplant in 2/7 and snapweed in 3/8 of the flower garden. Which flower planted area is larger?", "completion": "To compare the areas planted with sunplant and snapweed, we need to compare the fractions 2/7 and 3/8.\n\nTo compare these fractions, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form.\n\nLet's find a common denominator:\n\nThe denominators are 7 and 8. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 8 is 56.\n\nNow, we convert the fractions to have the common denominator of 56:\n\nFor 2/7, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 8 (since 7 * 8 = 56):\n2/7 = (2 * 8) / (7 * 8) = 16/56\n\nFor 3/8, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 7 (since 8 * 7 = 56):\n3/8 = (3 * 7) / (8 * 7) = 21/56\n\nNow we can compare the two fractions:\n16/56 (sunplant) and 21/56 (snapweed)\n\nSince 21/56 is greater than 16/56, the area planted with snapweed is larger."}

{"prompt": "The shape of the base side of the pyramid is a dodecagon. How many faces does this pyramid have?", "completion": "A pyramid is defined by its base shape and the triangular faces that converge at a single point (the apex). If the base of the pyramid is a dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon, then the pyramid will have 12 triangular faces, each connecting an edge of the dodecagon to the apex. Therefore, the pyramid with a dodecagon base will have a total of 13 faces: 12 triangular faces plus the 1 dodecagonal base face."}
{"prompt": "There is a pyramid whose sum of the number of faces and the number of vertices is 16. How many edges does this pyramid have?", "completion": "A pyramid is a polyhedron formed by connecting a polygonal base and a point, called the apex. Each base edge and apex form a triangle.\n\nLet's denote the number of faces as F, the number of vertices as V, and the number of edges as E.\n\nFor a pyramid, the number of faces (F) is equal to the number of base edges plus one (the base itself). The number of vertices (V) is equal to the number of base vertices plus one (the apex). \n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of the number of faces and the number of vertices is 16:\n\nF + V = 16\n\nSince the base of the pyramid is a polygon, let's denote the number of sides (and vertices) of the base as n. Then, the number of faces would be n + 1 (because of the base plus the n triangular faces), and the number of vertices would be n + 1 (because of the n vertices of the base plus the apex).\n\nSo we have:\n\n(n + 1) + (n + 1) = 16\n2n + 2 = 16\n2n = 14\nn = 7\n\nThe base has 7 sides, so it is a heptagon.\n\nNow, for the number of edges (E), we know that the edges of a pyramid are formed by the edges of the base plus the edges that connect the base vertices to the apex. So, the number of edges is equal to the number of base edges plus the number of sides (since each side has one edge going to the apex):\n\nE = n + n\nE = 7 + 7\nE = 14\n\nTherefore, the pyramid has 14 edges."}
{"prompt": "How many numbers not less than 40 and less than 80 are multiples of 8?", "completion": "To find the multiples of 8 that are not less than 40 and less than 80, we can start by finding the smallest multiple of 8 that is not less than 40. \n\nThe smallest multiple of 8 that is greater than or equal to 40 is 40 itself if 40 is a multiple of 8. To check if 40 is a multiple of 8, we divide 40 by 8:\n\n40 \u00f7 8 = 5\n\nSince 40 is divisible by 8 without a remainder, 40 is a multiple of 8.\n\nNext, we find the largest multiple of 8 that is less than 80. We can do this by dividing 80 by 8 and then subtracting 1 if 80 is not a multiple of 8:\n\n80 \u00f7 8 = 10\n\nSince 80 is divisible by 8 without a remainder, the largest multiple of 8 less than 80 is the multiple of 8 just before 80, which is 8 \u00d7 9 = 72.\n\nNow we have the smallest multiple of 8 in the range (40) and the largest multiple of 8 in the range (72). We can list the multiples of 8 between 40 and 80:\n\n40, 48, 56, 64, 72\n\nCounting these, we find there are 5 numbers that are multiples of 8 between 40 and 80 (inclusive of 40 and exclusive of 80)."}
